<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Can you tell us about the
oldest civilization before Atlantis? The very first one?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Well, there was recorded the
land of Mu. Of course that has nothing to do with Sun young Moon., but there is
the land what would be called of the Sun which is called the land or the space
of Ari. And in the space of Ari was the beginning and concept of the spirit of
man; sons of god, that did not really manifest on the earth, but did manifest
in a position in the galaxies of life and the cosmos beyond. From there they
had their sect and molecule structure of existence in what would be called a
sunflower design. Each which what would be considered circumspect a revolving
center of light by love and beauty creating and resound the impulses and
expertise of giving involved in the beauty and its seas of existence in the
primordal creation of being. This was the beginning of what would be considered
the colony or the colonization of planet earth. In this area, there was space beyond
belief that in considering the quasars beyond the heat and light pulsations of
its general course, they had a play ground that was immense beyond compare. In
their growth pattern, there was this development of sound waves of energy force
that rejuvenated, revitalized and rekindled a certain amount of wisdom and
knowledge. In this growing pattern, these qualities involved with the sons of
man to be considered the sons of god enkindled wisdom and knowledge continually
in which they encountered other civilizations past, present to come of all
decrees all lessons all learning, all trials, juries, all conditions of
sustaining, receiving, rejuvenating those powers of wisdom knowledge and
applying them in their daily is correct activity. You will also find that as
they would express in this elliptical orbit, they moved to resound or revolve
with speed of energy in which they became more developed and more emphasizing
the factor of energy, pure energy giving out rejuvenative, rebirth and
recolonize the worlds beyond. At this point they moved gradually to the area of
this galaxy coming in to the certain formulix felix fear or more or less the
elliptical pattern into the belt of Orion, through this quality they merged
into the what would be considered the lions pelt or more or less the lions paw.
Coming into this galaxy, there were many paths and patterns happening to take
this particular, develops certain solid qualities and characteristics that were
of ethers of elements of air bouncing in and out and never really being of the
same quality but just visualizing certain characteristics of growth and forming
the planets which would be considered Saturn and the belt that surrounds Saturn
is a exodus, &quot;exzemius&quot;quality in which the pen branched off with the
communications of the angels and archangels and other principalities within the
thrones of regions. In which again, lives these constant relations of con
formative discourses and rapport and growth patterns, developments through many
channels and reservoirs of learning. At a certain point, they decided they
would rather live closer into the solid molecular structures and got involved
with amoebas and what you know as parameciums and one celled creatures and also
involved with other creatures that are no longer here on the earth, on and on
and on, then one thing led to another as it always does and one small act leads
to a bigger act and another qualities from the archangels and the spheres of
the thrones had to make the solid gasses in which certain forms of planets so called
spirit planets had to be established. Of course, the Saturn planet was
constructed first along with the planet of Uranus and then there was tremendous
war, collision between the angelic forces which caused a great rift in the
decision between the sons of men, the sons of darkness and the rest I guess you
have written knowledge of..</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Why was there originally
the split, of the angels?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Power over the
creations within the new galaxies being made.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you explain the
language that you gave ( a while ago) you said it wasn’t sealed yet, it
couldn’t be given. I wonder if it could be given now?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The writings is a
form of music and sound rhythms and purposes, in which speaks about the origin
of the earth on levels of physical and of the etheric and the spirit level and
seven hierarchies above. These are the creation of the world, not as you see
it, but the happening of the creation of the world before it ever manifest as
the earth. There were many what would be considered forces of gathering
elements in which they became stronger and stronger, and in their own strength
they received the hope and the spirit and the light of development. Many
developed for the good, others developed for the bad. In the development they
became refined and greatly able to give. True spirit of development is those
with their own particular light, can give, of things, of something, the
elements around them. To give constantly is a true measure of development. As
we move on these forces came closer and closer, heavier and heavier into
density entirely forming what would be considered the third dimension by their
own thoughts. And then they manifest physically in the third dimension through
the elements that were most akin to their development. This is the progress and
pattern from the higher worlds down into the lower worlds that this creation
was made.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In the country of India
with their religious practices and beliefs and gods and systems of initiation
that are seemingly completely different than what we know as set up in the
Bible and all the various sources of information that we have. How do the two
relate, yet India is known as like a very spiritual country, but yet we also
know at the same time their stagnant in their spiritual developments. How does
it all relate?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: India is considered
the Pearl of Wisdom, India is considered the spiritual storehouse of the world,
India is considered the spiritual Mecca of Revelation, India is considered the
storehouse of all knowledge on a worldly conscious level. If you go to India
from one span of the breadth (breath) of the North Sea, up into Bombay, down to
Calcutta, if you go into Niger’s, if you go into the jungles, if you go through
the strange places, the temples, the Mecca’s, the Ganges, if you go through all
these items you would find a vast storehouse, even the grass itself grows
differently in India. You would find the air smelling very perfumed with the
berries (..), very strong with the (cries)(crowds), you would find that in
India is the recording history of Time. What is happening in India, the
stagnation is again through the misuse of the knowledge, to capture the souls
and keep it still. What is recorded in India, one might ask, what is in India.
Why do we call In-d-a, In-d-ah, In-the-ah, In-the-earth. In the earth the
history of time is preserved of every thing that has happened In-d-ah. So the
majority of what would be considered religions is the factions and factors that
are (sprung) out of the beginning of time. The beginning of time is preserved
in India, everything since the beginning of time is there consciously, open, in
the jungles, preserved in the temples, in the writings, in the sacred books, on
the trees, in the grass. Why are they stagnated, because they refuse to use the
information that is at hand. They refuse to open up their eyes and see the
information that is right before them, and in fact they distort, abuse, taunt,
change, slant the information that is already there. Therefore those coming to
India is only coming to the big show on the earth, that is the big zoo in
India. Different cages, different bears, different tigers and lions and
elephants, all is a show of the spiritual nature of man. All is the imagination
of mans thoughts of what spirituality should be and they all strive for this
image of spirituality. Imagery of spirituality is not a guru, is not a person
sitting on nails, is not a person hanging upside down, is not the naked bodies
in the Ganges, Is not eating your own dung, is not drinking your own piss. Yes
as gross as it might sound the urine is drunk by themselves, into themselves.
There is some medical factors proven that this urine is necessary for the body,
but remember, the urine is only a reflection of the waste products of the spirit
in the body. One does not have to resort to such measures. If one cleanses the
mind, then the urine would be cleansed already and no need for all these
devices, and works, and deeds to prove spirituality. The soul can conquer all
elements of the body. Look at yourselves, how much power have you given to your
soul. How much power have you allowed your soul to reign over you. How much
power have you given your mind to reign over you. How much power have you given
your physical body and your desires to reign over you. Where do you stand. Can
you stand up to that, the measurement of your own true self, alone in that
measurement, stand out from all this, from all that which binds you to the
earth. India only represents those qualities in which we get lost in the earth,
through the different parts of the body, and the mind, and the spirit, that is
the spirit body, the spirit mind. One cannot get lost in the spirit of the
spirit, for one is in the spirit of the spirit. Therefore one is not lost in
the spirit. But one is lost in the spirit of the body, or the spirit of the
mind, for neither can take them to the height of the mountain of the spirit of
the spirits. So India is stagnating, but if you go to India with your eyes open
and you perceive the things that are before you, then you will see that in
India is the history of time immortal, in the earth, since the beginning of
time, even before the earth was solid. Before that point when the spirits came
into the earth. Strange as it might seem, solidity, solidification, grossness,
the unique ability of seeing something in front of you and identifying it, this
is stagnation. Stagnation happens in many forms, in many ways. One sees one
item and therefore it becomes that one item. And not perceiving the thousand and
different items in back of it. The different pentacles, forces, angles that
come from the grouping through the mental mind of the one item. All things are
possible through God. Therefore do not stagnate yourself in living in the
prison of your bodies or your minds, let your soul take control and reign for
you. And let your soul guide you unto where you are to be guided, not to where
you would like to be. This is a misnomer, no sooner do you go to where you
would want to be, you no longer want to be there. It is a desire of the mind
and many are lead off the road and the path through their desires of pushing to
be in a place that is comfortable that is nice. For that place no longer
becomes comfortable once you have it. That place no longer becomes nice once it
is achieved. The true comfort of the body and the mind is in the presence of
the spirit. Comfortability can never be gained by living in a shack or living
in a room, this is worldly comfortabiliy. And it is a misapplication of what
your soul is seeking. We all seek after comforts, we all seek after harmony,
but there shall be no real harmony with a physical external comfortability. For
it only creates disharmony and discomfort. True harmony is that which seeks
after God and the Spirit. Seek not after it like those in India on the worldly
level, on the physical level, then therefore it will only create stagnation.
Seek the spirit and then the worldly conditions will be put into harmony.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: With all the different
idols in India is that part of past record or is that part of the stagnation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: All the different
idols in India represents the different energy force-fields that one who could
perceive all the different gods that traveled throughout the earth, physically,
the Higher Forces as you call them, not in directly to us referring, but to
them the higher forces or transcental, or triestrial earthlings or triestrial
planets or dibolic creatures, remember the dibolic creatures also have UFO’s
too you know. So therefore you have figures and symbols that represent these
visitors that have come to the earth and visited India. They have captured
their big heads, they have captured their big ears, their tiny eyes, their
marble lips, their scruchin fingers. Remember India has been visited by the
good and also by the bad.                             </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>…the Holy City or that which
is our home port. Yes, this area is called the center facet of our many
different networks of channel. Through this center facet, all our ships ascend
and descend because of the electriconic, vibratory and aesthetic values of not
only that which is around, but that which hovers above this area for decades.
Therefore, a secret is given to you all here that that is our in&#8209;put and
out&#8209;put of all ships on this earth. I would like to give you an
understanding of that speed in which we do travel through the galaxies and the
cosmos. It is the point in which that of an object moving to the speed of light
or the molecules surrounding it has in one sense become what would be known at
a thinner vibratorial or vibrational level in which an object at a certain
given length and sphere travelling near or to the proximity of that speed of
light will become what would be smaller in size and eventually disappear in
sight of what you see. Be not dis­mayed or alarmed by what we say, for that is
how we travel. From where we come from is fifteen billion light years away,
fifteen billion light years away. And that will give you the size on which we
have travelled and the spectrum of control that we have over the cosmos.
Fifteen billion light years away takes us approximately one minute to travel.
That we will repeat for your ears one more time. Fifteen billion light years
away, given by man's measurement of time, in the fourth dimension we travel one
minute. Therefore, be not upset by the length or the distance of what you have
measured to be and what could be capable of measuring. For if we take this
group to where we exist, when this group returns, they will not find their
civilization any longer. Is that understood by the group?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The adept-scription
and the definition of this is such. That when an object reaches that of the
speed of light, it goes into the fourth dimension immediately and disappears
into that seemingly fourth dimension. Therefore, all objects that have
disappeared on the global or the earth level have reached that band of light
that is surrounding the earth. There are very minute and lined details on this
global sphere that have the band of light which is a natural bar, that which
covers an object, or that which is the circle of that object. The given shape
of the sphere is represented in the form of this band. And when a ship or when
a spherical passes into this area, they disappear. On many cases of your ocean
area many ships have been noted to disappear under the ocean and above the
ocean. In this case, they have hit by accident the span of that which is the
dimension of the fourth, which brings them into existence ten thousand years
from this point on, pre­senting themselves in a strange situation, never to
return back to this ex­istence. For they cannot, once entered into the fourth
dimension, that one minute that passes or lapses is exactly ten billion light
years, or at least ten thousand light years from that point of &quot;A&quot; to
&quot;B&quot; from &quot;C&quot; to &quot;D&quot;. That is why all forms and
shapes and all mannerisms of that what you would say a wall is no problem to us
to enter into. For the walls and the shapes of the vehicle of the four boxes
that you see are no deterrent from us to enter and to leave. For they are not
what we seem, for we do not come from outside, but we come from inside the
forces of the elements that are within that force. Therefore, we materialize
ourselves from the atoms and the elements that are already within this. For as
you are in a room four&#8209;square, but in this room are countless cosmoses.
In this room is countless galaxies between your eyes cannot see. That, too, is
the cosmos of space, and each one has a particular planet and solar system in
it. And as you can see, comparing this, so is your galaxy like unto a larger
room to higher developed minds. You can see how infinitesimal the existence of
your very being will add up to. We are now, as I have said before, sending as
many ships as possible into that which is the Middle East to present a
destructive force to that which is against that city of Israel. Remember,
Israel is where we have our head center. In Mount Zion is where we reside and
the forces of that channel from upward and inward and outward. If they seem to
take over in control of this, then we will be very unhappy. And in this factor
we shall produce what would be another Exodus series. These be little people on
their minds, they should take care of themselves. Now for the description of
other objects that we will try to bless. In our existence we have seven suns
which represents the seven centers of your earthly bodies. Remember, all
composite or com­posite items of electrical forces have this element of seven
solar centers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Our sphere has the seven
solar centers manifested into that which is the perfect center. For there are
no other galaxies or other solar systems that have seven suns revolving around
it. That is the perfect manifestation of that spirit which is other God, or what
you earthlings call the heavenly realm, or that which is termed heaven, or that
which we have directed that guide who has come down from this area that which
his name wee Jesus, who had returned. As he ascended, he disappeared into the
fourth dimension, returning into that heavenly field. His return when he does
return back is exactly two thousand years since prior to this. So in this
condition, he can be seen into any realm, or any force field by the power of
thought. So the group has a mission at this moment to prepare themselves in
thought and form so that spirit, that which was Jesus, might manifest in them
on the Upper Room. This might take a period of a week, a month, a year. But you
shall see him manifest. And he shall speak to thee, just as we speak to you
tonight in this room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>THE BEGINNING OF THE SOLAR
SYSTEM</span></u><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>: In the beginning there was
nothing but the cosmos. The cosmos was void and empty. One atom combined by the
hydrogen and networks of that which was not from that which aggravated the
molecules surrounded by it. One molecule bouncing and negative of that power
create a disturbance effecting all other molecules from that point on in time.
For that point of friction of non&#8209;friction in the cosmos is a given law
of constant movement. For if one object moves in the cosmos, or in the universe
it has perpetual movement. There-fore, the friction that has been started by
that spark which is dormant, for there are two stages in the existence of the
solar system, that which is and that which isn't. For there are the dormant
stages and there are the active stages. That which is dormant is harmony, peace
and settlement. That which is active is what would be called disruption and
chaos. For as you have seen what we have described here is the methods and the creative
forces that have created your world. The peace and the disruption. Out of that
which is harmony in Genesis, you have disruption as what would be known as the
days of night. From this disruption created by the forces or molecules
surrounded by the global sphere in which they are encompassing a limiting band
in which they can only project to. At this point of their evaluation they had
progressed into a solid form of molecule and atom confining what would be a
solar structural atom or that which is a make&#8209;up of that of composition
XXK or that which is a solar flame. By this unperceived by the human eye, the
solar flame is what would be known as that rays of light and that light which
is unseen by the human eye, vibrating for countless of billions of years of
your earth time to the point in which they create a force­field around them.
Commercing into this they form that field, and forming the galaxies within
themselves. At which time after a billion years have passed, they have been now
become what would be called a neutralized sun in which is a very small
structure of your sun globe. After another billion solar years, they now
encompass what would be called twice the size of your sun until they have
formed their field or band of glare of affectivity. And by that point when they
have reached the outer strengths of that, there is an explosion sending forth
into the cosmos of what was in the moment dormant eruption. At this moment
through this eruption, or dormant eruption, they send into it solid flames of fire,
each flame instamactically takes upon himself through that law of inertia a
revolution and evolution of their met center force in which it came from,
causing that which is the system of your galaxies and all galaxies at this
point on. Causing from the very beginning as a center structure to the very
end. When each solar or hot mass becomes solidified, then it becomes like unto
the sun in the beginning, reaching out to the band of its affectivity, each one
will explode into millions of pieces, as what you have known as the Asteroid
Belt, which is the similar effect of this older planet that had erupted,
because it was the first planet that was sent into your galaxy or cosmos of
this dimension of solar system. Its each part is erupting then it sends per­petual
movement in which it has reached its band of dormancy, or that which is
silence. So at that point this galaxy that you know of it, will another
billion, trillion years from now, we will not give you the exact time, only the
Higher Forces know this, and each planet will explode back into its original
stage of dormanticity. From that which is perfect harmony it will return into
the cosmos of nothingness. From nothing it shall come, from nothing it shall
return to. At this point the cycle of the creativity of another galaxy takes
effect, and again that which is disruption comes forth upon that which is
harmony, causing the cycle to repeat itself once more. That is your definition
that the scientists are planning for billions of years and countless of years
to define, we have given you in a matter of a few minutes. We here have much
more to  show and teach and understand with you, but as far as your
perceptivity in your own minds at this development stage, we are only capable
of giving you only what you are ready to receive. Therefore prepare yourself
diligently for there is much more that we must give you. As far as that which
is the oil of spices of opening centers, this crimson oil represents the waters
of our earth or our planet that we have come from. From these waters we have
give and got our spiritual foods, for we give into these waters every five
hundred years, refresh our bodies and renew our souls to become alive for
another five hundred years. So then that is your system, from the elements that
surround you we have composed it into the form of giving you life. But the laws
that govern you might not have the effect upon this crimson, but we rest
assured that you have manifested into this earth, the waters of our planet. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We will tell you now that we
come from one of your very own planets that we reside on. That is the planet of
Venus. The clouds covering over this particular planet is remarkable, would you
not agree. But so is the cloud covering  over this planet. This is the way we
operate, in this particular point. When the Higher Forces, which will be named
the Highest planned to create in this solar system spirit of life, it all
started during that reign of the angel Lucifer-Satan and their rebellion
against the plan of God. Now as has been given before, there are many
hierarchies in our structures. As this entity has now undergone to understand
certain principles of it, we come in to fill in and give light to things and
clarification to others. In that beginning stage there was no force-physical as
you know now, for they are all of the ethers of spirit forms and forces having
no rebirth, no pain. None of such things exists. As we created out of this
darkness, for everything around us was darkness and void, and we began through
the powers that our God has given us to create this solar system by our own
thoughts. As is know by certain literatures that this entity has also trying to
evolve with, it is correct that Saturn was our planet that we have created. Not
the Saturn that you know of today, but the Saturn of a spirit ethal form. And
we had created this planet by our thoughts congregating together to form a
place in the mass. But things were dark at this time, so we gathered our forces
together and created what is the solar orb or the lunar or the solar orb which
is known to you as the sun. There were some forces at this time that were
asleep. When they woke up it was no longer dark. Out of the mist of this sun,
the waste material then became in the physical sense what we know today as
Saturn. From this standpoint everything was well. Just as everything starts
from the level and works on up from the material back to the spirit, from the
spirit back to the material…(end of side A)…There is much to be learned from
your own particular planet. For when the war between the archangels, for these
were particular ones that were underneath us. And certain of these rebelled
against our plan, we had to form a force to out-force their force. A war began
and that what is known as today, the asteroid belt, was once a planet that this
war took place on. You would find this between Jupiter and Mars. Then we exiled
these forces of angels and archangels to the planet of the earth, remembering
that was where they  were forced to. For the earth was just a star and of a
light force that was nor existing as the earth you know it today. Then there
came the earth that was spit out from our force, from our work. Some forces at
this time decided not to have any part of  creating this earth in the physical
sense, so they went and created what is known as Saturn in that area of Uranus,
Neptune, and Pluto. And that is where they reside today. But we decided to
create the planet of the earth, so we, through the forces of thought, again to
the solar orb, dispersed into outer space and spit out the particle that was a
hot, molten mass, a flaming ball of fire that represented the earth. This took
many millions years to your time to cool. As it was doing such, remember that
the Lucifer and the archangels that were thrown out gathered together on the
heaviest side of the earth plane. And as it was cooling and revolving, that
heavy side pulled away from the earth and created the feminine aspect called
the moon. At this time the cooling off of the surface began and the breaking of
species on the earth into sex began. For there had to be different poles,
negative and positive before the sex was created. At this point the origin and
breaking up of that physical being for male and female was manifested. And all
those archangels and angels now reside on the moon. And there they waited until
the earth was cooled enough for them to come into the earth to experience the
physical and lustful parts to the fullest. Remember one thing, that as the
forces on the earth solidified and the planets began to become,  as the oceans
were a hot-bedded mass of flame and fire, now become of a liquid state much
cooler. And the land became solidified. From the land became that which is
Lemur or Lemur in state became into that area in which dinosaurs and reptiles
and ferns and all that grew. From that came that of (…) or that spirit that was
the embeddiment of the first spirit form of what would be known as man today.
But it was on the spiritual level that it existed. But that which is as man
came from the sea, and his evolution was as a person of  a monster of ferns and
dorsals from the sea. And this was called the Dorsinian Age or the Dorsean Age
or the Pises Age of man. As man progressed upward and onward, then we came into
the earth force to show and manifest through the cloud forces for there was
much gas and much force that the sun did not exist at all. For there was nothing
but darkness on the face of the earth. For it was gases all over the earth that
existed through the hot molten lava and much more than that. For when we did
come through, we broke through and showed ourselves in the form of a dragon
force till they was that at that time manifested themselves too as a dragon.
For we take upon ourselves as the etherical bodies to manifest into the earth.
So at that point came the religious undertones of man and developed upward. For
it had to become a miracle before man was to be developed. And that is one
thing that your scientist today will find much problems, for it was a miracle
that you were created and not by a natural law.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Wasn’t man created from
the water?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Man was not created
from the water of what you would know it to be, but from the spirit of God, by
the spirit that created man through it. Man evolved not from the water, but the
physical body of man did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: No, no I mean the physical

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you...could you
explain to me the...how the three signs Virgo, Libra, and Scorpio operate? I've
read that they were...once upon a time they were three signs combined into one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This represents the
planetarial spheres in the earth when there was that other planet in the
heavens which was colliding which did separate into the asteroid belt. This
represented what would be called the combination of Virgo and Libra being the
scale, or the balancing of Scorpio. For it was the scales of Libra that
connected Virgo and what would be called Scorpio. They are the male, which is
Scorpio, and the female, which is Virgo, and the scale representing the
balancing of them to be one planet, one force. This was the force&#8209;field
in which man did not have to be divided, but he was woman and man together.
This was a time in which the entities did rain into the earth, did rain into
the universe in which they were one substance, one being, and did not have to
separated into the manifestation into the spiritual, physical, and mental
planes. When they had to be separated, then the moons and satellites came into
play, separating from that which would be called the earth negative or
positive, which would be called negative, being that which would be called the
planet. The moon and positive which would be called the planet of the earth,
reclusing that which would be called female and male aspergies, or what would
be called paragies, apergies. And in this reliance, all this had to be
undertaken, which would be the Zodiac signs. For from the seven Zodiac signs,
which was only founded up to Jupiter, that also verses into that of the Zodiac
signs of Virgo and Scorpio, which also had to be balanced out equally as well.
For the woman's sign had to be in Virgo and the male's sign had to be in
Scorpio. When these signs were created, the scalement of them or the balancing
of them became a manifestation as man and woman together in the earth plane,
residing these scales or these signs no longer to be one, but now separate.</span></p>

symbols of this Age?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Fast moving,
thinking, impatience, mod furniture, electric, souple, swift, lamps, scientific
research. But all this will not come to culmination until the end of the
beginning. But it is the fast movement of thoughts in time and space.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Remember that the mind is of
Satan. The mind is used by Satan. All this is part of Lucifer in the earth.
Lucifer is the one that questions and logically reasons things out. It is the
Mind that we are trying to get away from. And it is the mind that puts us
deeper and deeper into that of disharmony. It is only when you call upon that
as you know Michael, the Archangel for the power of faith and most of all for
the power of trust in your God can you conquer the Luciferic sphere of
attachment. At this moment in your social evolution you have the medical
profession at times involved in the what  would be called Lucifer Age. If man
only turns within to his higher self, then all these things that manifest on
the outside would be healed, or worked with or changed. But as long as man
continues to use his mind to find and conquer, it is not his mind, but that of
the Luciferic origin that makes man wanting to learn. Learning is a process
given to you, not by God, but by Lucifer. So in reality you have many souls
entering into higher forms of learning only in reality these forms of learning
are that of Lucifer’s origin. This is the battle that Michael has with the
earth. For remember the souls continue to evolve on the other planets. And this
is not the last planet of your evolution. You have that of Jupiter, Venus, and
that what would be called Saturn. All these things are just beginning. You are
now in the earth learning that of love and spirit versus mind and logic. It is
when we start using our logical mind do we find trouble. And this trouble is
brought to us only by using what we think logically is going to happen. We must
accept things in faith and love, knowing that it is God’s hand that directs us.
So, as you can see. The black force is very much in tuned in the earth’s crust.
Even at this moment as I am speaking, there is great force to try not to reveal
these things, to stop them. At this force, this Lucifer origin cannot and will
not stop you. It is being what would be called ever trick in the book to
prevent this group from moving on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How did Lucifer-Satan get
the idea to go against God when he was an angel without free-will?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The point that all
archangels were created by us to do the work as down the scale. They seeing that
they had to do and what they could manifest in thought forms, they did not go
against God. They only did what they wanted to do with the power that God gave
them. They did not create according to our plan for harmony, but they created
according to the plan of experiencing everything which in turn sets off the
whole plan that was first started. So now we have to go through this way before
we can continue with the original plan.                    </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Did you create life on any
other planets too?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The other planets are
inhabited by spirits that were created by the thought-forms of the archangels,
the archise as was named by this entity and by the angel forces on this earth
that was who you work with. We create by our thought-forms just as you create by
your thought forms. As the angel has fallen away from the plan he is forced to
go once more back to his original self. He must again climb upward, but this
time with man. He must climb upward with man and must experience the pain that
man experiences, even more-so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But not all the angels
fell down, or did all of them? I mean Lucifer and Satan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: And there were a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: That came along with Satan

that took over the earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But the ones you said that
took over Saturn, you didn’t explain who they were?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They were archangels,
no. They were our what would be called comrades that decided not to have any
part of creating the earth…End of side B…the other planets of Uranus, Neptune,
and Pluto and that which is one more outside of that range.</span></p>

start (can’t make out rest)?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Nazi movement
started when the son of Satan fell into the earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Son of Satan?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Very good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Who is the son of Satan
and that means Satan didn’t?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Satan could not fall
directly into the earth, but used objects and elements around him to fall into
the earth, by his own powers. He himself was kept into a barrier in which could
not pass or penetrate the earth field because of Archangel Michaels sword of
Paradise. But he too was cast out of Paradise mind you. But none the less he
uses son of Satan, which is the logical mind and the mental mind, the sons of
Satan are these two elements.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Who is then Lucifer?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Lucifer is a quality
which represents part of a santanic force, more of a masculine quality from a
the Lucifenic Age or better known from that part of Venus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So is Lucifer possibly a
son of Satan?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let us say it is a
depth of depth of thoughts and is part of the Luciferian vibration. There is a
point in which mathematics can be used, but when it reaches that point, it
becomes nothing but mental. It is like two lines drawing together, and when

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Prayer-Lord, in this hour I
come before you to strengthen my faith. Help me when I am weak to become strong
in the spirit, that my logical mind will not take control, that my spiritual
being will have the ultimate say.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You must understand
people, that your logical mind questions the spirit constantly, that the
logical mind feels it knows all the answers to everything. But how shocked we
are and dismayed to find out that the spirit comes forth and confounds always
the logical mind. So at this point we’re only saying to you: Silence your
logical mind and open up your spiritual essence, your spiritual powers. By
doing so, you can walk on territory that has never been walked on before. So
Silence your logical mind and let your heart open to the spiritual essence of
life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Isn’t there a price for
opening the spiritual side and closing the logical? And what is that price?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Opening up the
spiritual and closing the logical. Price of evolution of the soul movement
forward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But there is physical
consequences?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, certain cells
within the body are vibrating and they cannot be slowed down once started.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What are those cells?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Those deal with the
stability of the mind, causing a great deal of mental depression and
schizophrenia they call it, manic depressions as they call it; All this
terminology is just the explanation of mind going through its bends and once
vibration starts, should not be stopped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Does also in consequence slow
down other cells as it speeds up these?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It brings the heart
cells into shape and function. When it is terminated, it turns that into fat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could I have a little
better understanding on the last thing you said?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Cells around the
heart vibrate at a certain rate. When one turns away from the spiritual path
the cells that vibrated at certain  rates and stopped turned into fat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I’d just like to know
about selfishness, what it is and why, why. I don’t understand it. Where does
it come from?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: In the beginning
selfishness was from the individualized soul that was created from the Godhead.
It traveled through many eons of space and time in which it had possibilities
of enhancing it through its true self in which it was its true self.
Selfishness was not known in the kingdom of the kingdoms in which the King of
Kings did reside in. Selfishness was not discovered as a feeling or an emotion
or an excursion until the down right onslaught of the angelical host. It is
called the angelical host of destruction and also it is advisable to say
selfishness is the turning away from the Godhead. It is what would be called
gratification and glorification; same, and at fault.. Selfishness is a
simplified and is very simply put as one who refuse to listen to the truth
within. In the beginning the truth was with him (them) all as they did travel.
But as one was riding up higher and higher in the astral plane, they saw the
development into the physical plane, as the material plane known as the
galaxies that you have here set it in what is called the Milky Way. It is one
of many galaxies that  reside and sprinkled around into the pattern and the
work of the clay of the cloth. It is what would be said again, were (where)
these souls traveling through eons of time, but there is no time, again repeat
it no time, but measurement of man on earth we speak of time. As they did
travel they saw the development and as what would be called the law of
evolution. Evolution was being in progress on this planet called earth in this
galaxy of Antpont Eff. It is called from this that the souls did take away many
upheavals into it and did enter into the vibratorial expressions, more so the
gratification of selfishness. Selfishness is the attunement of only desires for
desires self achievement and gratification of not listening to. Selfishness
again has not been known until these souls did travel and did come into this
existence and did take upon the vibratorial forces and gratification’s within
it. You all have a long way to go before you realize that true Godhead within
yourself. The only way it will and can manifest is by (1) Love : (2) Faith. By
these are the cornerstones of the universe and galaxies. We ask that you love
of giving of self and through faith of not wondering what you look like as far
as ego is concerned, that you all will progress to your true Godhead. And the
truth that is within yourselves will be manifested. Selfishness is the desire
not to do what you can do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well Neptune is a
strange planet, it seems to have come from other planets around it. It is some
theory here that Uranus threw off this glob and it became ah Neptune. There is also
another theory that it is the galaxy towards psychic Revelation and
Developments. There”s also some belief to be the overlapping planet that

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How about a small piece?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: A small piece would

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is all stone made out of
entities like you described about soapstone?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They give you the Age
of Stone, soapstone to be billions of years old, that should give you an idea
that it was near in the time of Atlantis. It is the magic potion of Atlantis,
the magic power of their energy. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How is the soapstone
converted back to energy, through magic?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Slowly and through
time and energy of prayers around it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What does it do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It allows things
around it to grow abundantly. It gives out energy. If you look at your Stone of
Prayer or Alt you will see your trees behind it. The trees are zooming up
higher and higher than ever before. It is not normal for those trees to grow so
fast as they&quot;re growing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What does the stone
serpentine mean?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is a substance
that could represent the ability of building, of sacrifice. Serpentine is that
of the soap material, built under the great abode of many, many dinosaurs and
many prehistoric animals. A vast graveyard of exploration. In this area many
prehistoric animals once roamed. Also in this area was considered the
headquarters for some of the Atlantean investigations of material and
scientific research. You will also find a major pyramid of what would be called
the lunar orb or the solar energy factor for the northern hemisphere, near that
of Florida and that off the coast of Virginia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Can you give us a process
or covering or something, on soapstone sinks, to make them look nice? Maybe a
formula for paint made out of soapstone?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Soapstone reacts very
strongly with certain acids. But not a direct acid. Lemons have some action on
soapstone. But remember the soapstone is a mystical stone, that contains
everything that would destroy and it comes up with the antibody. In fact
soapstone is one of the living stones that has its very being by being very
hard, very(?dark, dull)and very strong. Yet by being very compassionate, very
soft. Soapstone would be considered one of the Divine stones. It is considered
one of the Christ&#8209;like stones in the stone world. Besides that of
diamond, under terrific pressure, soapstone is made out, the elements of what
be considered metaphysical and physical prehistoric beings. These beings were
servants to man. They were so reliable, that when the sons of man wanted things
done, all they did was think and these beings did. When the Age of Change came
and the Age to destroy the outlandish beings, the good beings, being found in
soapstone was also destroyed. Therefore bringing over their qualities of
tremendous ability and durability under extreme conditions, but giving way to
the most subtle sword or blade in refinement of them. Soapstone has a reaction,
in which when put on the stone, unto an acid, they produce the same exact acid
on top of the surface of the stone, which would mean that the acid will never
penetrate the so called stone. Therefore it is considered a living stone.
Living by its what would be considered exorbent amount of reaction, action with
the elements placed on it. We would say that the only thing that can clean
soapstone is soapstone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now those beings that are
entrapped, are they entrapped in the stone or are they the stone?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They’re the stone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Therefore instead of
totally eliminating them' because they were good, they were given the stone as
their abode?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: As their expression
continuum.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So that’s how come the
soapstone is a psychic stone and giving off light?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct. Soapstone is
only the physical reminiscence of the Sons of Light in a day, bygone era, that
no longer has its reminiscent on earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So in that case, are they
alive also physically in another world inside that stone?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You can take
soapstone and put it to your right ear, concentrate in a perfect manner and it
will reveal certain secrets to you, of that age.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is the idea I have
correct, that soapstone was like a vehicle for the higher Sons of Light, like
the ships and this is only like the remnant of the ships, their living beings?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That would make
correct sense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: There was a book that
described life within those trees that do not move, but yet was a life in a
droplet or something. There was a whole life, there’s a whole culture. Is that
something like it or how many entities is one stone or how is that done. How is
that kind of, is there a culture there. Is their life dimensional kind of
thing?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There is a variety of
ways of analyzing a particular stone. Measuring how much entities are in it.
There could be the way of sanding down particles of the stone, putting it under
so called primitive microscope and seeing how many</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>different cata&#8209;gor&#8209;gor&#8209;ies
of designs you have under the stone. In so doing you will count the exact
amount of so called beings from the stone. There is another way of graining,
how many grains are in the stone, physically seen</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>determines how any beings in
the stone. A grain separates one being from another being. There is also the
weight, volume, the weight of a stone over 10 pounds will mean there should be
after the 10 pounds, at least 3 beings, after the 27th pound, the 50th pound
would have 4 beings, from 50 to 100 could contain at least 20 beings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is that how man came to be
bursting the stone manifesting qualities?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Man came to be from
the Beginning of Time in the Breath of God. Man got trapped in the earth where
he had no business being. But then became his business.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But what you’ve been
saying is that these stones are (?giving or living)?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: That means that somewhere
along the line man as stone had to manifest a certain qualities where God said,
it is ready for you (?Jesus)?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let us not go into
this. The stones have a servant attitude to man. Jesus is only expressing the
ability in which these stones themselves will cry out and give voice to the
proclamation of truth. That is the meaning of putting your ear to the stone and
listening to the certain secrets of ages gone past</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is there any connection
between this group and that which we know as being involved with Greek
mythology?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: All that which was
called Olympus was Atlantis or Atlas, as would be called. It was on this hill
that a great school or pyramid of thought was built. Here certain individuals
were found.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You mean to say that those
were ordinary people of the earth that made certain achievements?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We would say
spiritual forms manifesting in a much more denser condition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But those weren’t people
from the forces?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you describe the
religious ceremonies that took place in Atlantis?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Everything was a
religious ceremony in Atlantis. That question you will hold for the next time.
It will take time to try to explain to you as the sun comes up and goes down,
the religious services took place. From the adoration of the solar orb to the
setting vibration's speed of light, Everything was in a service.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you give us a
description of the religious services that took place in Atlantis?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You would find them
lasting for 47 days, from lasting for three days, from lasting for four hours.
Each consisting of the singing and the praising and the raising of the ethers
around to such a degree that it changed and improved all the area for many,
many months to come</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell us
something about the religious ceremonies that took place during the high time
of Atlantis?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Generally they dealt
around the astral communion. Or the spirit level of walking back and forth from
whence one had come from.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you. A long time ago
-------had asked about the religious services in Atlantis, and it was said that
more information would be given at a later date. Could anything else be given
about Atlantis?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The particular
services carried on some for several days in which the power was raised to such
a point that photos and pictures of other galaxies appeared to those who were
worshipping. Also the effects of the building and atmosphere came into
manifestation after a period of seven (7) what would be called cycles. This is
when they were in the proper focus of services.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What would be the proper
focus?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Sincerity of heart and

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was there any positive or
good things that came out of Atlantis?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Atlantis wasn’t so
bad, its just the decent of Atlantis that was bad. There was a great spirit
following in Atlantis, where they had ceremonies at least 4 to 5 times a day.
And these ceremonies were kept alive to maintain the stability of Atlantis.
When these ceremonies diminished, Atlantis began to break up. The greatest
power that came from Atlantis is the spirit and the serving of the spirit in
ceremony, prayer, and laws.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is there a form of service
today that comes closest to that form in Atlantis times, when it was in the
right track?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You have the service
of singing and psalms and that of consecrating of the host in Eucharist, which
represents the high sacrifice that took place on the altars of Atlantis. Of
course then it took place on an etheric level.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In the Cayce readings on
Atlantis, he keeps mentioning things or entities that were  used as slaves.
Could you give me more information about these entities?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: These entities were
used as thought&#8209;forms at first. They were created by the spirit or soul
essence in which they manufactured or Created these forces. When these forces
became alive with the will of the soul, the soul made all manifestations and
abominations against this thought&#8209;form. Thought&#8209;forms becoming
imprisoned into what would be known as their slaves which would later become
manifested into the period of the great beast. They were used for much work on
the physical and mental level.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So like some of the
Atlanteans themselves, they were their thought&#8209;forms that created their
own slaves? That manifested physically?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct. That would
be found as more accurate in a description of their servants or serve he&#8209;mates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you. The slaves of
Atlantis who...who...who gave them a soul? Since they were monsters and not
according...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They did not have a
soul. They were robots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: They never received a
soul?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Were they robots, only a
fleshy body instead of metal? Or was it actually metal?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Robots in thought
forms. Not metal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Then these entities have
never progressed anywhere else? That's it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There is not
progression. They were stagnant. They did not exist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In the Cayce readings
given on Atlantis, there's never any mentions of Mu or Oz' What happened to
those continents? Can you explain on that one?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Mu or Oz. moreso Mu
is a take&#8209;off from where the Atlanteans came from. It is a migration of
these souls that developed. There have been re­corded, but they have been
misplaced in the history of that (     ) of record.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Well, what happened to
them that they migrated to Atlantis?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Destruction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Where did they come from
before Mu?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Heaven.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So is Mu the first on the
earth plane where man manifested himself physic­ally?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: On the spirit plane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I remember when they
talked of Mu they used Spiritual existence. Does the, mean that there was never
a physical continent of civilization of Mu?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It later near the end
came to manifest on the earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was that the first
physical civilization on the  earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Also, at the time of
Atlantis, was Atlantis the only land mass that was populated on the earth? What
were some of the other areas?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The other areas were
those around what would be called barbaric natives. Areas of Ifanite, Mezmite,
Iznite, Missolpolnite. All these are the nites of Ethanome. </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Do all of those nites,
what we know of as scientific evolution of man from the ape or whatever man
from the one cell?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: To degrees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So would America in spirit
and...would America in spirit and also in a physical land mass, could it be
like a reincarnation of Atlantis?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Positive. </span><span

style='font-size:12.0pt'>Accurate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And then at this time for
the most part is the same thing happening again?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You have all been
given the format and the choice once again. At the time when you all left, to
the land of Yucatan, Iizanite, Pizanite Yucatan, Iza boyiel equanot. Izsquare
azqune. By the power in which you have all left the  land of Atlantis traveling
through the forces of the eons of time, you have all came to perceive the
Forces. And then when things get so heavy, things are so heavy that you have
left that which is silent and have gone toward...don't worry. And you broke the
barrier of time and space and you are flying in the air...Going far
away...Heavy...Divine self...We are so heavy...The spirit was
free..Spiritual... Everything is silent. The body so, so heavy. And the  spirit
is so free,so light, and yet your body is like a stone, a stone...heavy, heavy
stone. And the spirit wants to get out of it. Oh, how heavy...how heavy the
physical body is. So, there you are. The time in Atlantis you were light, and
now you are all so heavy- So,heavy. You have chosen a good path &#8209;to make
your body light. Stick with it so that you might rise above it and become light

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The discussion that we had
last week or so about the four rivers coming together and forming a circle
possibly around Atlantis, being involved with the energy there, could you give
me some guidance on that? Or are we on the right track?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You were accurate. Four
rivers were those rivers that came from the north of the country, or the dome
shape in Atlantis, and spread like unto that throughout all the land. It was
used to clean that which is stored energy into the land that this community was
established, tapping the energy to the border when a certain instrument was put
into it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you. What were the
four rivers in Chapter Two of Genesis?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: These four rivers
represents the four rivers of Euphrates coming from and entering into the four
centers or four parts of the world. This represents the pillars of the four
centers within the lower body that must be spiritualized so the rivers will
flow on upward. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Where are they today? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In Genesis where it talks
about the 4 rivers, the last time you told me Euphrates represents the south.
Could you tell me what the others are.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You have the 3 other
rivers which would come from the solar plexus, from the thymus center and from
the pineal and the thyroid center. These are the 4 other major rivers coming to
make the Garden of Eden.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What direction would be

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: River Pison.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The centers to the
particular rivers are varied in strange different connections as you would read
on down the 1<sup>st</sup> river dealing with the spiritual understanding
coming into man, applies to the force going into the leyden and into what would
be considered the gonad system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Second river which would be
in the force of Gilhad or Gilad (Golgatha?) with that section being near to
Jerusalem, near to the Holy City and a place where Solomon was consecrated
King. It represents the consecration part in our consciousness, to preserve
wisdom and the cection from that point of the pituitary gland, this would be
from that particular river.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Then you had the Hiliad river
which could represent  that of the Tigris which represents the flowing of
energy throughout that creative force, a rejuvenation  and the reclaiming of
old lands. It is also what would be considered that part flowing into the
sector of the thyroid, but into very strongly the thymus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Then you have the Euphrates
which would represent the Spirit of Life, the rejuvenation power throughout the
body, the bones , the teeth, and the blood, the eyes and the movements of the
senses. This could represent very strongly in the liver section and also in the
lungs. It is also to be found very strongly, again coming from the thymus into
the pineal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In the Bible in Genesis
where it says, God takes the rib out of Adam and makes the woman. At that point
there wasn&quot;t a physical body. What does that represent?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is the
formulating of the physical substance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Why did they use the
terminology rib?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is the joining
between man and woman. The Breath of Life. You will find the same message that
the nostrils of all living creatures, the breath of life was extinguished in
the time of Noah. This was the expression of all those creatures all creations
during this moment in time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Those that had turned
evil?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: State of affairs in
the earth at that moment of Noah, came from the moment of this creation from
the rib.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So that was a bad thing
already at that point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It grew to have its
dominion and violence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What happened before that
that caused this to happen then?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This was the lowering
of the standard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: This happened in Adams consciousness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It did happen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Also later on it talks
about Adam had become as one of us, to know good and evil. What does this, how
does this fit in?</span></p>

at this time.</span></p>

become as one of us to know?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: He became the
consciousness of knowing all things, but wasn't really able to handle it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So it was sort of a God
consciousness?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We wouldn't really
call it a God consciousness. He already had the Spirit of God within him. It
was the consciousness of the laws.</span></p>

them at that time?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: He became to know
them and then became responsible for knowing them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you. Why was it
needed for God to make again all the animals for Adam to name them so he can
find himself a helper, when all the animals were already created?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Creation of a pure
race without distortion of that of the Baali forces.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So even the animals that
were created in the second day, I believe...or third day...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: ...was distorted by
the elementals around them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Oh. Then the woman that
was finally con...was the woman considered from the beginning or was it
something else that was considered in the beginning?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The woman was sacred
from the beginning. By her con­ception, does she bear fruit and fulfill her
purpose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What did it mean when it
was said that when the animals were created that their names indicated their
sexual condition that they were in?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: By every name that
the animal kingdom has, breaking it down, you will see the centers in man that
it represents. The gonad system is a very easy system to conquer. All you have
to do is ask God constantly to help you and develop you through his light. The
gonad center is a relatively easy center, for it is nothing but imaginations,
and imaginations that is hot air. Knowing and seeing and putting into proper
perspective, you will become free of your self and be able to breathe as a
human soul in the earth. We here are taking a special interest in your course
of study in the Bible and we are pleased that you have gathered together and
listened to our word on Tuesday. It is very interesting moment. It would be a
moment of re­cognition and development. We ask you to continue this to
understand that through these forces it will be possible to understand the
centers and the geological and the physiological patterns in the earth. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Can you give us your name?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: ...(Language of the
Galaxy spoken here)...In short, latnos.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Has this language ever
been spoken on earth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: In every form of
languages. It is a combination of many of your languages. For, in short, your &#8209;languages
were created by our voices, into which these people heard us speaking. A new
discovery into the zoology of creation, that the speech only came into faculty
when we became here to bring into man the awareness that he can utter the words
of facultations and con­structive thoughts by moving of the vocal cords. Or
otherwise without this, he was as, as what would be said, he used the word
&quot;Awg&quot; and '!Ugh ''.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was that still when man
was in the form of fish?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Man is always in the
form of fish. He smells most like it. Man, having no need to communicate but
falling down into a pattern of degradation, walking into walls, into sand&#8209;pits,
into marshes. Seeing this plight, we had to come and give them a force of
voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Then, the Tower of Babel,
what was that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That was the force in
which they themselves thought they could communicate with us and climb higher
to where we were hovering, so they can take command and control of our city.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was this in physical form
already?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Our city was in a
physical form, correct. The tower still remains in what would be called asunder
slum­bers in that which is northwest of the area of Barcedon or Babylon, what
would be new today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Babylon is Iran. Is that
correct?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: A little further to
the west of this country, or nation, or state, or city. That which allies
parallel to it to the northwest of it.</span></p>

latitude. </span></p>

outside the Garden? Was was...what was their life and what was the world like
outside the Garden?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: &quot;Question Book
on the BEGINNING, Four­-Five&#8209;Two&#8209;One.&quot; In that which is called
the beginning of time or the space of illusions or the creation of crea­tions,
in that which would be called the beginning of essence or the measurement of
time or the measurement of light, in that which would be called the measurement
of sounds or the measurement of bodily pressures incarcerated flesh, in that
what would be called the spirit forming into the earth and the molecules
around, in that what would be called the creation of the sixth day finished, all
these aspects taken into consideration, is only one part of the aspect of Eden.
Eden was a place protected and surrounded by a force&#8209;field, twenty by a
thirty&#8209;four cubic inch High, fifty&#8209;five to fifty&#8209;four
thousand seconds of the watt. All that aspect in which was encompassed within
this Eden was known to man to be beneficial and productive in his development.
When man transpired, when man entered into the world, he began to incarcerate
that of meat, disposing of the flesh and assuming that quality. In the beginning
of time, man would eat an element and became that element and took upon that
quality of that element physically, in which that was the battle that went on.
Man tried to fight or force his way out of this. In that aspect you will find
that there were the suns of suns, planets of planets, and that of numbers. The
num­bers were against the suns of suns. The suns of suns were against nothing.
And the planets of planets were against the suns of suns, and the measurement
of numbers. In this the existence began and was begotten. And that of man came
to walk, As he walked in consciousness, he would revert back to that of the
other field of develop­ment. With the greed for material success and the greed
for recognition by man's superior deeds,  there was a gradual decline in morale
and general structure of work­manship. In this, such a case, was the enemies of
Satan exposed everyday, that everyday should be that mark or that re&#8209;establishment
from the Higher Forces, creating, working, delivering the aspect of the woman,
and all phases to develop her and preserve her interest in that life, In this
respect, it would be better for discipline more before taking into the hands
that of a dangerous weapon. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: At the time of the Flood
what was happening on the earth and what was happening on the spiritual level
and how was the Flood accomplished?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: At the time of the
Flood there was a great war between Satan and Michael in which Satan was
getting too routy and too possessive of the earth and was about ready to be in
control of it, for which Michael came in and had his hand to hand battle which
left lots of scars on Satan and totally tilted the whole earth. The comet was
not really a comet but was the force of the message of Michael and Satan around
the earth constantly in the force of battle. The polar caps of course as was
mentioned did alter, the caverns in this area opened up and released the water
that’s excess. In fact the caverns are still in excess in these areas and when
the earth tilts slightly these caverns let loose the water that is like a tub
or a cup on an angle. So if you move the cup in any direction the water will
spill. Also caverns within the earth opened up under this pressure and released
the water that they were holding. And of course the rain was coming down
releasing the moisture in the air constantly through this action.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Where did all the water
go?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well it dried up,
some of it went back into caverns and some of it went back into valleys and
gullies and holes into the earth and some was absorbed into the atmosphere
others was absorbed into the mountain (forests).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How many Arks were there?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well there was the
major one you are reading and there were several hundred in the earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Can you tell me if the
Levites were the original ones</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>that built the...were in
charge of building the ships like in Atlantis and...?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Levites were in
charge of the electrical magnetic field Of&#8209; the sun, the moon. The moon
was what? The moon was what? The moon was what? Anyone know what the moon was?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: No.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The moon was what?
The moon was what? Does anyone know what the moon was?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: A portion of the earth
broken off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The moon was a
portion of the earth broken off. Correct. In the great explosion in which
darkness fell upon the earth, and tilted the earth axis to outer shape and
form, in which as you know, as we know, as we all know, the earth is not
straight up and down. It is what? Tilted, of course. The rea­son why it was
tilted is because the abominations that was in Atlantis had to be eradicated
from the earth and uprooted and transmuted and transformed and transcend the
hell out of the earth! Excuse the language. But, in short, the earth erupted
like a pimple, exploding the pus into the atmosphere. And it conglo­merated
into the moon. That's why it has so many pus&#8209;pockets. Acne. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the levites were in
charge of keeping the earth in balance after that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: But the moon is very
powerful, nonetheless. It is a strong instrument when it’s full, and a very
powerful instrument when it's new.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What happens on a new
moon?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Becomes what you
would consider dark. And the moon radiates certain forces in the earth, that
rejuvenates and regenerates certain parts of the cell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Can you tell me who
was...or what tribe represented the building of the ships?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Sounds like the same
question. Levite.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you very much.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No problem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Can you tell us more about
the people of Atlantis? A physical description? Like occupations? Like what
they did?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Sounds like a census
going on. Atlantis... I know you will not give up. You will keep pounding at
that until you find every information that we have on it. The people were, what
would be called, olive green or yellow gold or they had no complexions. The
were like chameleons. They turned according to the climate and conditions in
which they traveled. They were very tall people now, -----, in which the eyes
were bigger than normal, in which you would find that the &quot;Big-foot&#8209;,
as today would be called, was a prodigy of these people that came from the
other Galaxy, as they call it. Now, in short, these people turned colors. The
ears were a little bit stronger. And, of course, now-----, if would dig
properly in Anarctica, you would find a whole lot of these people cap­tured in
the ice, now--------. So if you're really strong enough, which I doubt, and
willing to go into the Anarctic, which I doubt, and start digging fifteen
degrees latitude, three degrees longi­tude, give or take a latitude or
longitude, dig a hole and there you will find approximately fifteen thousand
people buried side by side in a mass grave. Don't tell anybody because the
leprechauns done like that to be disturbed because the walrus that are down
there di&#8209;da&#8209;dl&#8209;di&#8209;di&#8209;di,they like to eat, you
know .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: They are eating these
things?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We didn't say that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How tall were those people
in Atlantis?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Seven foot six inches
to eight feet. Some were even fifteen feet, mind you. Those living up in the
North Pole. Now, if you wanted to go up to the North Pole you would still find
them living.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Those are the..?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: In the earth, of
course. I have a smart group here. That is the light that comes from the earth
that you see as, what you would call, the aurora borealis. Yes, that light is
their inner light that gives them sun. So accordingly, if you see a Big-foot
running abound, remember, that is them Inside the earth that, you know, how it
is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are they going to catch
him?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: All this information!
Be careful! Don't misuse its But, who would believe you anyhow?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is anybody going to catch
one of those people?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Remember, man is
still an animal. These entities or people up in the north called Big-foot read
the minds of man, smell the minds of man. They can smell a man out fifteen
hours before a man ever comes a hundred miles to them. They can hear the
thoughts of man forty&#8209;five miles away. They can put man asleep by a
certain sound to their brain. So you tell me, if they catch a big-foot, he
either will have to be snoring or going to the bathroom. They do stinketh!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But they are men. Are they
not? Those...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let us say, they are
big.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Do they have a language to
each other that..?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Mental telepathy. And
high squeaking voices which says that words of languages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But are they considered
human beings?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We are considered not
human beings. You are considered human beings. They are considered superhuman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Why do they come on top of
the earth then?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Because they would
like to have a vacation. They come on top of the earth to gather certain
stones, certain electrical impulses, and certain vibrations to bring back down
into the inner earth. Also they are trying to tame man by taking females and
propagating them, getting them ready to take on normal physical forms to enter
the earth again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So Big-foot can enter the
earth again?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: In a normal size.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And yet with all their
super&#8209;duper powers?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So actually humanity here
as a whole really failed?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is not successful
by a long shot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Yeah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It can be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Yet at that time,
you...you said there were what they are today called the Big-foot, they then,
too were fifteen feet tall and also they had a big difference to the others
that were eight or seven foot tall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So were they also super?
Were they always then a race to itself?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

&quot;Incandus&quot;. Who knows? In the reality of life, there is a
perplexed...perplexed mystery of the secrets that lie beneath the earth. These
creatures are limited when they are underneath the earth. They cannot see too
good under the earth. Because they see not with the eyes, but with sound, And
the sound bounces off the walls, so they bump into things. That's why they
cannot see it. They have to come out of the earth in which they can see by the
sound that's enabling them to see man forty&#8209;five, thirty&#8209;five,
twenty&#8209;five miles away. Because they see differently. That answers

Jupiter. Re­member the rays of the energy comes to the earth, but also the rays
of the energy goes to Jupiter and transforms of different light&#8209;waves
comes back to the earth which, if the scientist today can utilize not only the &#8209;sun's

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What kind of foods did

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Food?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: If they had blue sk...?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Food? They ate like
pigs! The food was the ethers. That from the ethers they could think the food
and there it was. Today food becomes a little bit more solid. You have to wait
months. You put a seed and your watermelon comes up. But that takes time, no?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: But the miracle of
that food if you had a time lapse, a time machine, and in the period of three

Correct? Correct?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Group: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There you have it. It
is Just slowed down a little bit. Aren't we smart?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What are...what are...what
were their occupations?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Occupations? They
refined light, the wind, music, buildings, domes, highways, transportation.
They brought the spirit of spirits into the earth. Cultivations, clothes of
spiritual essence, You would see, what would be called, the material that you
had on today, the sari, as they call it, If done and spun nicely in silk, that
would be the closest ma­terial by the silk&#8209;worm to what the Atlanteans
did. And now a worm does it. And man can't even come to the quality of what the
worm does. Correct?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Group: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You mean to say this is
part of the de&#8209;evolution that a worm can do something man cannot do?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct. Beautiful,
is it not? A person would give his eye&#8209;teeth to listen to this and to
understand it takes much more, That is why we cannot talk too much about
Atlantis to you because we do not want you to feel sad, or heart&#8209;broken,
disillusioned human beings. We want you to have an ego. We want you to believe
how great you are. We want you to be happy. Hard work is the only thing that
will break the chain. The harder you work, the higher you go. And work is the
doorway to the past. They know that. So the door shuts and they won't open it
because you're not working.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How did they...did they
have any form of exchange be­tween one and another? As money or something else?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There were four
kings..five, to be exact. Each had his own providence. Each had his own empire.
In each providence was a barter system of gems. One was rubies, sap­phires,
emeralds, and diamonds. Each was a different conscious­ness. Each one was a
different light. There are places in the world that emeralds are buttons!
Diamonds...but that was the barter system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Did they have them in like
round little balls?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They were not the
same as they are today. They were spirit. They were fire. They were light. You
could not hold them in your hand. They floated. And now the energy that floated
is trapped in the stone. Until they come again and release them. And then they
will float again. Understand?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I think so. But if
they...do you mean actually that those stones had other power than just their
own value?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They were spirits of
healing, of light, of elements, of the true spirit. Don't you see? Excuse me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So actually the barter
system was really not any kind of a barter system?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They were the
movement and flow of spirit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And yet the things that
they have accomplished like transportation, buildings...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They have magic
today, even though they are in stone, they still enlighten the soul&#8209;essence
in every one. They sparkle the truth. And there a little inside that stone and
they say, &quot;I am still.&quot; They are a genie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Do these stones or any
other stones have a consciousness?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Walk with me and we
will show you Atlantis as it used to be. Sit back and rest and close your eyes
and do not open them, no matter what happens. And listen to the story that used
to be Atlantis. Atlantis, Atlantis the once and great land of spirit, For the
sun was always high and the stars, they touched the sky. In Atlantis the people
flew by. And they slept in the twilight of the sky. Their dreams were not only
of the earth, but it took them far beyond to the hotpoints of the sky.
Atlantis, Atlantis. Why, my poor gem, you were radiant and full of life? And
now you are but a gem. The stores were shaped of golden lights that vibrated
and pulsated into the night. And the ships of speed and light streaked by on
their path and sight. And they traveled around the globe and into the earth. And
they traveled far into space. And at the same time they were a divine race.
Atlantis, Atlantis, where have you gone? The glories of your day have passed
and are gone. The waters were spirits of blue and green, yellow and gold. And
to touch the water was not the same as today, for they were waters of veiled
silk and cotton that slipped through your spiritual fingers. As you move your
hand through the air, so was the silk waters of Atlantis. And the music that
raised from their edifice pierced the dome of creation. And gave glory to God.
For everything revolved around circles of light, of peace and harmony, of
beauty and contentment. But in the strength of their civili­zation, there came
a king from the north that wanted damnation. He conjured and forced the people
of spirit into a material substance of fiber, into a grabbingness of material
thoughts, and pulled down the crescendo of spirit. And all that was spirit they
wanted to define. For at that point, there was no boundaries. Nothing had no
side. But he, the king of the north, wanted shape and form and size. And he
worked hard at controlling the boundaries and set side against side. Until, as
time progressed, and thousands of years evolved, he still lived. And the paved
streets of fire gold and the emeralds of the lights turned dark and gray and
black. And then the great spark, and man became solid. And a war of eruption
began. And the fight of the lighter forces against the heavier forces began.
And tried to tear apart what was materializing. But it was too late. It was
done. And then the eruption of this solid mass became so strong that the
fineness of Atlantis could not hold the boundaries that were being set and the
eruption began and the great mammoth animals and the ugly forms that took on
became worse and worse, and communications fell down, and things deteriorated,
and then the end of the eruption. And the great migrations of spirits of light
into the many distant parts of the non&#8209;cultivating lands, And then man
had to start from a new consciousness again to work hard and build himself up
out of the trap he was in. Atlantis, Atlantis, where have you gone? Your light
was radiant greater...That was part of the story of Atlantis. Here ends that
chapter. So you ask for Atlantis and you get all this information. But remember
when you ask for Atlantis your heart should be in pain, for you ask for your
past the way it was, the way it should be. Work hard and manifest the spirit of
light around you, and beauty in art, and beauty of music. And then you shall bring
back Atlantis with Joy, and your body shall be transported back into its true
substance. Refine yourself and be refined just as Atlantis was. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Who was that king?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We cannot give his
name at the moment. We do not want to give the name. To give the name would
evoke Satan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: It is not Satan? It is
just one of his disciples?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let us go on with
other questions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Can you tell us anything
about how the energy from Jupiter could be attracted? Could be harnessed?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It can be harnessed
or honor or harnessed with certain filters directed on the planet for ten years
and at the end of the tenth year then the energy of cooling would come in. But
man doesn't have time. Man is too busy. Man doesn't have time for the many
miracles around him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What would the filters be
made of?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Will we as a group be able
to bring forth that which is needed to utilize the solar heat the way it should
be?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: We should not repeat this
one? Just continue?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The energy would have
to take, .will take many years to be refine, to be developed, to be worked, Man
has gotten lost into his own mental logic, his own dissecting of what he thinks
is the right, Yes, he will take solar energy. But he will not make it what it
is or should be for another fifty to sixty years. Yes, he is a child, and the
solar energy is new to him, he thinks. It is as old as the earth. Do this. And
have it strong. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: As the brain is the focus
of the minds of all the cells in your body, is it that different parts of the
body contribute to the subconscious part of the brain and the conscious part?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Or does each cell..?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: In every cell of your
body is the whole structure of you. It contains the brain to the foot. If you
take a cell, you would be able to make the same structure as you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So clone...cloning is not
really that far&#8209;fetched an idea?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is that White Forces?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is the same force
that made monsters in Atlantis.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So with the forces of the
anti&#8209;Christ that are coming up now would be like the same that destroyed
in Atlantis? The exact same?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In Genesis in Chapter One,
it says, &quot;And God created great whales and every living creatures that
moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind.&quot; Is
there anything special about whales and why they were...why were whales
specifically said?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They came into being
when the sons of dark­ness came and drew the line into materiality. And their
own words they inflated. As long as the whale is on the earth, so is man's ego
and mind.</span></p>

is there anyway to make like a machine or something that could be called a
machine that can transmit matter back into the past or into the future?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes. You'll find that
machine in the Bermuda Triangle. You want to go on a trip?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And did it one time exist
above land? And now is below the ocean?</span></p>

beginning and the end.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So it was...?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: If you made a
triangle...simply represents the vibration of the ray from the machine that is
buried right underneath the ocean. And....(whistles)...it comes up! So anyone
who passes the wave of that vibration that moves with the currents, you see?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Oh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Gets caught into the
vibration...(whistles) ...tricky.</span></p>

problem that if somebody from now went into the past and did something
different...what happens?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It has already been
done. They went into the past and it is now the future.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So that it would be that
here and now no change, no great change?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It's already been
done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: It's already been done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Question. The future, as
we call it, or past, as we call it, are these something to our understanding as
dimensions that actually simultaneously exist constantly, always?</span></p>

that one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the beginning of time

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Opposite.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The lesser light to
rule the day and the greater light to rule the night. And then it manifested as
the greater lighter to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night. In
short, during the day the light was of a different nature. And during the
night, there was no night. Then through their actions they became the light of
the day stronger and the light of the night weaker, because of their
consciousness. The moon was created at that time because of the decadence.
Remember, as God was creating in Genesis, thousands upon thousands of years was
passing by.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: It also said that God has
created the heavens and the earth. Now if that was the defining of the lines,
which is not really a good thing, does it really mean that as black forces were
defining, trying to give a heavier substance to things, God has made a stoppage
point of how far they can go with that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So that’s...that is then
the force&#8209;field.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Those things that I
considered petrified castles, is there such a thing?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You would find these
what would be called &quot;kronkins&quot;, or castles of rock in which
indirectly are the energy fields for the black forces long before man or the
son of man became embedded into the physical body. The earth's crust in certain
areas, Arizona, New Mexico, you'll find also in France, Egypt, certain parts of
Turkey, certain parts of Tibet and Lebanon these particular energy field
centers. Some are white and some are used for the black side, of course. These
particular castles were not used for productive means. It was the landing or
the extension for the Lords of the North, demolishing team of destruction in
which was still embedded in this land. Very few of the White Forces success has
ever come from that land.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So those castles
really...were they also at one time actual castles that got petrified?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They were energy
fields that came from them a housing of force on a material level to destroy in
which it would be said a castle&#8209;shape resided.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now with the entity Ray,
is there anything you can tell us?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is a soul that has
been retrieved from Newfoundland. Inside there is tremendous work to be had,
but it represents the seed of truth from this particualr area to be saved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The Beothuck Indians in
Newfoundland, would they be the direct descendants of Atlantis?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell us about
one of the major sections of Atlantis &#8209; its trade, its spiritual
development, its commerce, its art, its social structure?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The major parts of
Atlantis would be considered the seacoast, bottom right&#8209;hand side, known
as Lanthius or Lanthea, or part of the black force, Lapi, all these are cities
within networks of cities. The major contract and commerce would be taking of
the silk from the ocean and spinning it into cloth, for at that time the silk
was about an inch and a half on top of the foams of the ocean which would
reflect light. The light would be made into a garment that would be considered
today electric. Major other source of income is the pearl and also the rubies
that were lying and to be refined and cut into shapes and designs. Population
could be anywhere from 23 billion  to 23 million. Musical instruments were the
reed, the wind pipes, and string instruments. This was portrayed or played up
in the atmosphere, and it drifted on down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Where did that section of
Atlantis lie in relation to now?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You would find it off
the coast of France.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Can I ask Where did the
early Hebrews originate?</span></p>

(1023461879200.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What was the Last one?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Last one is a bunch
of numbers that is geometrically in opposition to that of Arcturus in which all
souls did enter into the communion in the earth plane in which they left Arcturus
into the land of Pylia. Entering into Pyliyam they left and became into the
physical bodies manifested into the Actariam Age or what would be called the
Age of Nomuntis. The Age of Nomuntis is the Age of Polaris which is at this
Moment coming upon you. In which Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury and Venus align
together into the angle of receptivity into the Spirit of Understanding of the
Atmost. And the Atmost is the name in which you would have to understand as
(The Name) in which the giving of the Spirit of the Light into the earth. The
number is a calculating form in a geometrical and also mathematical survey, in
which if you understood what the number was given would give you the exact
position of the anti-matter planet in which is the opposite planet in which you
see here. That is what would be the other sphere of the heaven or the other
dimension, in which all those that transit from this plane will enter into when
they go. Some have called it the plane of heaven, but it is not heaven, but the
plane of the spirit world in which the spirits do enter for recuperation. And
God knows they need to recuperate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So there is actually a
Garden of Eden, is that what you’re saying?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Garden of Eden
was in Atlantis in the third sector of Emodius or what would be known as near
that which is what would be known, one moment please, Idyan, the Garden of
Idyan. In which all the spirits or that spirit, the name of Lillith as that
spirit that came to earth, the beginning which was known as Eve, did come here
and reside there in spirit form. Is this understood?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Yes. So she didn’t take on
the flesh body, is that it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That is correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now I didn’t understand
about Arcturus. You said that that’s where the souls come into this universe,
through Arcturus souls come into this universe? Is that correct?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And through Arcturus they
also go out of this universe?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They go out, but they
do not go out. They go to another planet or another sphere of another sphere of
invisible vibrations. Then from there they enter into the earth. Question?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are there females among
you?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Here there are no
sex. Therefore I could be a female. Does that strike you funny?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: No, I’m just trying to
picture….</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Us with any-ding?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What, I just don’t understand….</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>As far as what we have told
you in the beginning, as the time of the beginning, the great destruction of
that planets(planet) that lie between Mars and Jupiter, causing the Asteroid
Belt. From that time Lucifer-Satan was cast into the spirit of the earth. From
there came many progressions in which they developed into many forms. The
Atlantean period lasted a long time into the degree that the Lemurian Period
and the Atlantean Period were one. These souls in the Lemurian Period were
development on a spiritual level in which they were still in a way barbaric,
but their development increased as size did. Atlantean Period, what is now the
Eastern Seaboard, was the foot lands and the coastal lands of the Atlantean
west side. When Atlantis went under, the Rocky mountains and what would be
called the Andes appeared in the earth, compensating for the great mass of
movement. At that time a great migration of what would be named as the white
race, that was created to bring the spirit of truth, vibrated to Tibet. From
there they infiltrated to all governments to bring the spirit of truth and
order. At this point, this is where we have our takeoff from. Also the great
laws of the commandments of God were infiltrated by the force of that which is called
the Solar Being, in which you had noted that day, in which Moses himself was
confronted and faced, face to face with our space forces. In that point we
projected into him the laws of the tablets of constitutional rights of
development of that which is government of people’s souls. The universal law
that we have given him. Many a times we communicated with different people on
this aspect, giving them the laws that would govern and direct the people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What did you mean you have
your take-off from the time of the white race?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This was a place that
was upon the earth in Tibet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You said you had your
take-off from the time of the white race entering Tibet?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This so-called white
race became in reality groups such as this preparing for many changes in the
earth and that is the white race: groups of people coming together in a spirit
and accord of working. This became one against the other or arguing between
that which was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How did from the spirit of
the earth progress many forms? Do you mean man or beast or both?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let's say both.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: That's from Genesis,
right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Then Lemuria was never
manifest on a physical level?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was there one race created
from the Carpathian Mountains? Or was...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I'm sorry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Continue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Or was it anywhere else
that was manifested?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It was near these
mountain forces. Remember the pigmentation is taken on by the mineral structure
of the terrain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: By the mineral structure?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The skin absorbs the
mineral vibrations from the stones in the terrain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So actually God did not
create five races but he just put them in different spots and they created
themselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But then they have all
developed different things...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Different mineral
vibrations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is it true that the yellow
race is now coming up?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is destined.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: China?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: More like Mongolia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Mongolia? Will they have
fights with the Chinese and Koreans and...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We will see.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you. Was Tibet
mountains at that time or was it something else?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Fertile plains.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you. How were the
monsters of the sea first created since man was first sea monsters, how were
they created?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Man was a sea
monster!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Maybe not, but wasn't man
created from the water?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Man was not created
from the water of what you know it to be) but from the spirit of God, by the
spirit that created man through it. Man evolved not from the water, but the
physical body of man did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Oh. It. was that physical
body, the physical body evolved from the water?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Then was that physical
body a monster or what was the shape of it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It gradually turned
into monster characteristic when the spirit of man took on his form of
rebellion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Then the mermaids, is that
what you mean about the physical body within the water?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And that you created? No?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We did not create the
monsters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: No, no, I mean the
physical body in the waters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We created the sea
and the evolution of such.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you. Did they have
any intelligence at that time?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They knew what they
had to know. Now the people know nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So at that point they were
highly evolved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How do these physical
monsters relate to Atlantis and their slaves?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The physical monsters
related only to those that had people or souls guiding it. They were just
servants. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What is meant by &quot;So
he drove out the man: and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubim,
and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of
life?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This represents the
very difficult path in which man must once again find the secrets within him
through many tests and trials and tribulations that once man finds this inner
side, this power, it could either be used for good or evil. That is why it is
protected so carefully.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So are there people that
have passed through that and then used it for evil?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: If they would reach the
sixth center, would they still be able to use it for evil?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It would destroy them
at that point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So they really couldn't
use it for evil?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Once they leave to
that point, they have left the point of protection. Then the destruction takes
on the process after that point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: That means the cherubim
and the flaming sword are the will center?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: More so to the pineal

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Isn't that the sixth
center?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You would find that
this defense mechanism is there to protect the will and the power of decisions
rightly, but if used wrongly, it is a destructive measure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Oh, I see. So that's the
Cherubim and that's the flaming sword?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: That power to destroy

mean, yes, karma, but it won't destroy in the same life?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes and no. It would
have the same effect.</span></p>

is also what would be considered strength mechanism.</span></p>

strength...so that would also represent the sun then, the cherubim?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And the seraphim?</span></p>

the connection is between them?</span></p>

night. What does this all mean? I couldn’t understand certain things that I was
questioning Tom?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It would mean taking
into consideration that the devil has his disciples and so does God. That the
devil offers his disciples great magic’s and powers. But God offers only
progression of the soul through kindness, through wisdom, through patience. And
eventually in which progression into which is the Christ. Nothing is speed up
in the evolutionary pattern and the only way it can be speed up is through the
silence. Also, what is known as Lucifer, has given certain powers only to reign
a thousand years. But the thousand years have come to an end. And now it is
God’s turn to reign. So a thousand years will reign on the earth. And as you
saw for Satan, so now you shall see for God. Is this understood?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Oh, it could be actually
the same thing?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Only by who’s playing

is different. And their objectives. Is this understood/</span></p>

got as much as I…the answer as much.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That is very good.
Remember that God already has the score of the game. And he knows who’s going
to win. That is a crooked ballgame. But it must be played out to the end.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Well, I think that was
part of my objection. Why does it have to be played out in the hands of
Lucifer?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Because the entity or
that which is named Lucifer in the very beginning was cast out of the heavens.
But from that point he was told to go see what he can do. And after he
finished, then God comes to see what he can take and undo. And the power of
Light is over darkness. And the Light curses the darkness. It is futile for
Satan to continue, but he does because in the end he will lose himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So after this thousand
years, there is, is there going to be again a cycle of Lucifer a thousand
years? Is there always a cycle of thousand-thousand?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Until the Christ
Spirits enter into the earth. Maybe after this thousand years is up, that
thousand years will not progress. And then we will go on to other galaxies in
which Lucifer does not have control over.</span></p>

Adam?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: On the earth. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Why did Adam have to name
all the animals before he was given Eve?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: These are the
qualities within himself that he had to put under his power or obtain. Man went
through a great evolution before all the animals were named.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you give more
information about the evolution?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The development from
a heavy set of experience and encasement in the earth to something that would
be more giving and more inclined to bear of itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is that like Atlantis, did
that take place in Atlantis?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Before Atlantis ever
existed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is that  Lemuria?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Before Lemuria ever
existed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was that in a spirit
world?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It was in a spirit world
but even beneath that spirit world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You mean the entities when
they fell didn’t really fall to the earth, they fell below to another, to a
lower consciousness than what this earth is?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Something similar to
that. There is a thin layer in the atmosphere that these elemental force
reside. Chances are you would see it hovering above your head on a foggy day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And that’s the lower
consciousness?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is a lower
elemental force-field that now  revives (resides) there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So human beings were
elementals?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Not of the elemental
force-field today, but something in a similar fashion that would float above
the earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: They were conscious?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They had a question
of the conscious thought within them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Did they do anything, what
did they do?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Oh, some just sat
around and others just waited. And more others got more involved and more
driven into the elements of the force.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Which turned them more
black?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Which became heavier
and heavier.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What finally did the
change to the lighter things of the earth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: More of the entrance
of the Sons of God into the earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Did they have that
civilizations with ah buildings, things like that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well something that
would be comparable to today’s civilization, but nothing near to what they had.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: They had more?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: In a different more,
that is intricate fashion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And yet they were grosser
than even us?<br>
Forces: Even before that yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So really they do it
through their intelligent mind or something?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: On the power of the
force of thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is there any book that
relates this story that we could get?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You would find it
given to you in books. There might be a message of Lillith which explains some
of the lower forces or those moments in time that happen then. And there are
other creations that would go along, The keynotes of astrology and formation of
the astrological world of pre-Atlantis could be a good informative book.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Before man can meet his
own soul so to speak, he must first name and gain the power over the animals
and this is what’s represented when Adam did that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

what...what a cubit was at the time of Noah...Noah? That he used on the ark?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is a measurement
of space in which represents from one center to the other. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was it...there wasn't no
like inches on a physical level? A number? A measurement?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It would equal a
little bit more than in Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Did the ark go into
another dimension, the original ark?</span></p>

hiding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What do the animals that
Noah took in represent? And why 7 (seven) pairs of the clean and 1 (one) pair
of the unclean?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Represents the
qualities within your body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The elements of things in
us to work with &#8209; the 7 clean, one for each center? The one unclean the
gonads that we have to work with? Is that...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What does it mean
&quot;...and the Lord shut him in&quot; Noah, after entering the ark?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: He was sealed from
outside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: By you?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: By a ray of tar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: A ray of tar?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What does it mean
&quot;...flesh with the life thereof... shall ye not eat&quot;, Noah after
coming out receiving the laws?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There were certain
things...of animals that were not able to be eaten.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: It means it will poison
them?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It would bring back
the old race.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Today, too?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Today it is a
different story. At that time, it just so happened to preserve that because
there were races in the animals that carried over the genes and the problems of

says in the Bible or is it...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The ark was put into
proper size after the whole ordeal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Oh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Does that mean like you
see sometimes in the movies or something that there was a machine or something
that reduced the size of the ark? Or put it into another...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Wood has a habit of
shrinking...and swelling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How many feet is it now?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: A certain sound
vibration over the par­ticular wood expanded it tremendously. Nobody would be­lieve
you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Then it was smaller. So
what does it mean if they find and they conclude that this is Noah's ark, that
means that they'll have to go by...to go by the measurements in the Bible and
say that before they thought a yard is so and so...a Bible yard is so and so
feet. Well now they'll have to go and say a Bible yard is a different amount of
feet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And is that what...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Then they will find
another item ac­cording to the Bible and the feet will be completely different.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Does this...does this mean
that Noah built a small ark and used the sound to expand it to hold all the
animals?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Noah had no other
choice but to build a small ark in the area he was working. He did not own
enough land to build a large ark. As the flood came the sound was heard and the
ark grew bigger and bigger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How big...how big is it
now?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No bigger than a
bread box.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How many feet long is it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We could say twenty&#8209;seven
cubits.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What's a cubit?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We would say three
hundred and forty-­five feet long. Or three hundred and sixty&#8209;five feet
long. Or two hundred and some odd feet high.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: It sounds...three hundred
and sixty&#8209;five feet. That's three hundred and sixty&#8209;five days. Any
connection there?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Interesting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Also, it's a year. A three

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Three hundred and forty&#8209;five
day’s that’s a lunar year.</span></p>

half a year wide.</span></p>

thirty feet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Oh, <u>in </u>the ark.
Then why were they preserved if they had that potential danger in them?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It had to be this
way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: For the future?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: All the animals were
potentially good.  It was then that it was decided upon that bad quality could
come back , not by their doing, but by man's doing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Then that goes along with
the animals that are kosher and non&#8209;kosher?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: It says&quot;...at the
hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man&quot;. Then how come
later on you said &quot;an eye for an eye&quot;, or is that Noah...or is the
eye for an eye only in the case of pregnant women?</span></p>

base of the bridge or the base of the Ark(Arc) that runs from the top to the
extreme, you have like the rudder to the front parcel part.</span></p>

the clouds were gone and disappeared, and at that time man began to see the
stars for the first time, and the sun, and began to know the Lord thy God is
One, and they worshipped the sun&#8209;god as one god. And this is the
beginning of God’s laws upon the earth. For there was never a sun, and the sky
was never blue, for it was always clouds or vapor around the earth. And for the
first time they began to see out the sun and the stars, to begin to have a
consciousness of God, a higher consciousness and development after Atlantis was
destroyed by its own evil. They were people of the Taureans, or called the
Taurean sect in which took over the Atlantean empire, or capital. Those people
are the priests or the kings of icons or icons traveled up to the north. And

monsters of the land.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And they went to meet to
deal with that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well they had to
meet, it was already dealing with them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Does that have a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What was the Last one?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Last one is a bunch
of numbers that is geometrically in opposition to that of Arcturus in which all
souls did enter into the communion in the earth plane in which they left
Arcturus into the land of Pylia. Entering into Pyliyam they left and became
into the physical bodies manifested into the Actariam Age or what would be
called the Age of Nomuntis. The Age of Nomuntis is the Age of Polaris which is at
this Moment coming upon you. In which Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury and Venus
align together into the angle of receptivity into the Spirit of Understanding
of the Atmost. And the Atmost is the name in which you would have to understand
as (The Name) in which the giving of the Spirit of the Light into the earth.
The number is a calculating form in a geometrical and also mathematical survey,
in which if you understood what the number was given would give you the exact
position of the anti-matter planet in which is the opposite planet in which you
see here. That is what would be the other sphere of the heaven or the other
dimension, in which all those that transit from this plane will enter into when
they go. Some have called it the plane of heaven, but it is not heaven, but the
plane of the spirit world in which the spirits do enter for recuperation. And
God knows they need to recuperate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>February 12, 1983</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you explain once
what you said on Numbers and the relationship to the ARK? You called it
&quot;diamond quality of numbers&quot;. What does that represent? How does the
diamond go along?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: In each quality of
life there are different facets of development within the quakeum of
understanding and in such all things are reflections of the evolution of the
mind of the spirit of God within the earth  and this spirit that is encased
within the physical body has different reflections of the (endogen enderteton)
spirit and the enlightened spirit of understanding or therastic comprehension,
in such there is what would be considered the parallel relationship between the
spiritual forces of centers of man with that of the spiritual forces and
centers within women. Have man women relationship between the universe. In such
as the understanding and cooperation of the earth elements being the fire,
water, air land and the ethers around. This and the combination of the
planetary effects upon the earth, planeteous and all those elements of plant
and vegetable and mineral nature have a combination force that is in the center
linkage of the ARK. The ARK is made up of an understanding&#8209;of cosmic
energy encased within that of gold and layers, of wood encased that within the
Law. The Law is made up from the beginning of time that is what would be called
mercy and harmony and love and forgiveness and justice and judgement. All this
is in combination to the epitamae and the apractamat particle and parallel
apogies of the spirit that lines around the centerfuge of the earth. In such an
understanding of the earth's complex erotocated surfaces and of the inner
thorous and caverns of the earth into the core of what would be considered the
orb of the earth or the hot house of the molten pot, all this in
conglomerations of the internal movement of the earth's retory of back and
forth. In this is the combination of the papogee and perigee of the force of
motion in which again the ARK is in resemblance to the bars and the poles of
ARK carrying force, these two ARKS that carry that slide into the loopholes
represents the axis of the earth revolving around the pivot of the NORTH STAR
that gravitates to that of what would be called ORBOS MINOR or SOLAR MINOR,
which is represented within the sun or SOLAR CROSS. When the earth is pointing
to the sun or SOLAR MINOR the earth's environment or souls so that there are
environments, the earth have a what would be considered a base nature or
quality of development in that sphere of understanding. Again when the axis
which represents cylindrical forces of man and the evolution of that energy when
the axis points to the NORTH STAR or POLARIS you have an understanding of true
spirit and the consciousness of the souls that enter into the earth are usually
opinionated and strong in nature into the true spirit of one force. In this
great force and culture of evolution the earth is a returning back to the
POLARIT or POLARIS state. It is simply called the POLARIC SPHERE OF INFLUENCE
or the POLARIC NATURAL FORCE or THE POLARIC ERForces: The POLARIC ERA is that
representing the loopholes or the carrying of the ARK within that of the earth
and the heavens, touching not the earth nor extending itself to the heavens,
the axis in which it is carried is by 4 by 4, that is representation of 4 march
4 march and 3 march 3 march underneath and 4 march 4 arch behind. All this is
into the second phase of its extension in which those that do perceive the
presence and understanding of the cepafuge comes to the significant force of
the gyro or centrifugal force of understanding within man. In the electrical
body of man again the ARK it represents the centrifugal force of motion being
that you have the centrifugal force that parallels the different apogees again
north and south being of different rotations and extending of different
latitudes and longitudes. Centrifugal force is the motion of movement of one
ray (way) to the other. In that of the human relationship between governments
and societies, representing centrifugal force within the ARK each represents
different governments or consciousnesses and evolution of man made manifest
within the very beings of the three dimensional era. In this centrifugal force
in the northern latitudes it will go clockwise while you have in the southern
latitudes it will go counter clockwise. This is the law of evolution that man
is made to go counter and clockwise (and to) and sphere of evolution within
that what would be called the sigmot and the pratic nervous system. The pratic
nervous system is located within the sacreatic nervous system and also what
would be considered the pleuratic and pleurase channels of tube lights and the
medicidal undeausaya oleos or the tube center leading down into the channel of
the spine this sporatic nervous system is assimilated and cannot be seen by the
naked eye or machine, but is the impulse of impulses which is an electrical
impulse that goes by the geratic  nature of governments and states and also
latitude and longitude. Give a creature of a different place and origin and
nature within the land of mass being one from the north and one from the south
the poratic nature of the spinal poratic spirit or said spirits &#8209; SPIRIT
OF FORCE OF NATURE within that system will have a rotation akin to that of the
gyro of the centrifugal force. Being that all is movement within the body you
will have an understanding in time that the fluids in the body of man goes
counterclockwise in the north. You take the same amount of fluids in the body
of man to the southern portions of the temperate zone being the northern
temperate zone and you have the southern temperate zone and there's a ZOLAC or
what would be considered the tropical space of man or the tropical zone, that
is the body will have counterclockwise fluids. (This is a very strange
phenomena but not yet discovered by the society of medicine that the heart
pumps counterclockwise within its chambers in the southern portions of the
earth )In the northern portions of the earth the chambers of the heart pump the
blood clockwise or counter, counter clockwise that is that one is clockwise
within its chambers blood pouring into its chambers could be clockwise. In the
northern hemisphere the same would be true to any liquid force that vibrates
within the southern hemisphere you would have a counterclockwise. What does
this all mean? We are representing or talking about the inner ARK or the ARK of
the space within, that is the force of the elements of space that is made
within the ARK that carries the LAW. The LAW is the centrifugal force that
dictates the movements of nations and governments. Be it that nations and
governments dictates the body force within it. Being that you might have four
within the same room that have a standing space (place) each one can be
represented and be identified by not only its centrifugal force within the body
from where it goes, but the very cellular molecular structure within that cell
itself, taking the individual cell that nucleus does not rotate clockwise in
its electrical sphere but in sporatic system or the medoti nervous system or in
the structure of the cell there is called the embriatic stage system that is
the invisible cell that makes up the mortal cell. For every cell that there is
there is the embriatic cell that is also the invisible cell. This is the same
principle in which you will have its cutting of the leg or the foot or the arm
or apature from the body in which calls the phantom pain. Phantom pain is the
continuation of the cervilatic cell structure within the body that is extending
within the auric or what would be considered the space in which that leg arm or
whatever regardless, except of course the head that that space would take up or
(for) its space (place). In this invisible center or space those cells will
still remain in its place or will be considered in tact in the phantom pain
remedy. There are many different tests that could be followed but this leg of
aperture will still have sensation of pain that would be unexplainable to
modern science, but the pain itself could be described by all in many different
ways. Also you will have this so called freedom of space but the continuation
of space proving the existence of the invisible cells versus the physical
existence of that cell. In the cell you have again the northern latitude moving
the nucleus of that cell in a counter, counter clockwise, not a counter,
counter clockwise as you would find in the southern hemisphere, but you would
call it clockwise, clockwise in the northern part and counter, counter
clockwise in the southern part. This here is the energy flow of the nucleus.
Cancer cells are created by the counterclockwise in a counterpart and a
counter, counter clockwise in a counterpart. What we are saying simply is that
cancer victims can be cured by sending them down to the south in a different
area in which the normal cell or cellular molecular structure is going according
to that hemisphere. Those in the southern part who have contracted cancer must
be sent up to the north in order to counter affect the cellular structure in
that hemisphere, making the natural elements of the earth work for them and not
against them. All this is in the            understanding of the ARK of as you
would have considered the gold that enlayers the ARK plus the wood that makes
the ARK. The Shittom wood is the buoyancy of man within the water, space in
time along that of the ocean and the earth space of space of time, all this is
in the storehouse of movement, even though the law is in preservance of water,
wood, weight, light, gold and gold itself to encase the structure of eminence
and radiance of the LAW. As we would understand the LAW itself is encased
within the space of the buoyancy of man/woman in the spirit of the universe and
in this so doing the LAW must be carried. All things that you see that are one
is combined and unified under the LAW. No one in any shape-form or space can
evade the LAW. The LAW can follow and will follow you in Texas or in New York
or in Virginia. The LAW is one. That is the meaning of HEAR O ISRAEL, THE LAW
THY GOD IS ONE. Not the &quot;Lord thy God&quot; but the &quot;Law thy
God&quot; is one. That covers all space and time. Now as the wood is made as
the basis of the feet, principles of man, basic principles of the bone
structure. In such the phantom nerve system is located within bone structure of
the bones that extend in the aperture. In the same structure you have the
phantom nerve center that radiates above the center of the bone or radiates
above the portion of what would be considered the enamel or the enosos part of
the bone. This bone is where the invisible thought forms and visible electrical
energy forms, flows above the calcium part of the bones which is the perfect
conductor of this natural energy that is invisible to man but visible to the
spirit of man. As the spirit of man ascends and descends into the top of the
head it must be conducted and is conducted through the bone system of man, not
through just the nervous system of man that is in the extension and is the
underlying portions of the nervous system, but it must and the proper conductor
is of the enamel part of the bone that enables the marrow and that point (part)
which is the muscles (musses?) that surrounds the mussels of these centers that
conduce (conduct) the energies of the spirit. Man is a structure of many
different forms and ways and these spirit is food not only by &#8209;bread
alone as the spirit has sent but every word, and the word is the healing of
this center. It is through the spoken word that this center radiates and has
its active healing power, as you can understand that the word itself through
music song, what would be considered speak and talk has a certain melodic
structure within this center that gives health and healing to the body. As you
can understand in the ARK again, in the radiance of the ARK you have the gold
encasement. This is the representation of the refinement of the earth and all
its elements on the earth. This brings you to the diamonds and the rocks and
the sapphire and the rubies, the emeralds and the garnets, the pearls, the
jades, the amethysts, the opal, the afire, the afideous all these are stones
and reflections of the spiritual LAW that radiates and gravitates from the
structures and the facets of the stone. Of course as you speak of the diamond
and the facet of this reflection it is the reflection of that one spirit of
that light which is within the essence of the body. As you would know the
diamond has its own eternal light within and it reminds the son of man that the
soul of God or the light of man or the energy of man is given by God or the
Higher Forces through the relationship of the cosmos which is in ever sporatic
and ever inducive battery of recharge, charge and recharge. As we would say the
gold is a constant recharger and it is a continuation of energy as it is
carried through time and space. So it is with the body of man and woman that it
is given energy in the new day to come that it might premanant the LAW of force
and nature that it might have its being and operate and to express that spirit
of energy. This is the focus of the gold plating and also the energy that is
within man that gives him or her the gold plating of force. All creativity is a
reflection of the spirit of creation, just as that of the spirit of the Divine
Creator, so man is the co&#8209;worker of the Divine Creator. Now we have also
come upon with this explanation and talking about the lid that covers the ARK.
The lid is that represented within the skulls sor sorbor or the what would be
considered the medusa or more of the medullum area and also what would be
considered the lobel (lodel) or lobe area; label: this is the covering of the
skull which is in many different fractures many different sections and pieces
within the skull for in the skull then are many different holes that is
naturally made, and these holes are pressure holes to allow the pressure within
the body to be released gradually. That is why water on the brain is affected
by the spirit of soul level, because its pressure centers are changing and
altering into a spirit sense. More or less this is the covering of the ARK
which is the covering of that spirit within man as it moves through time and
space. There are many more different explanations and understandings of the
ARK. This should suffice you for the moment for there is more learning and
understanding with this particular lesson that will shake a stick in many
different directions. For as the leaf falls from the ground you know not where
and what spot or space that it will eventually fall. For it has different 
directions as it falls and turns and turmets and falls. Eventually when it
falls to the ground it still is not in its right position for the wind and
natural forces doth shake it, but the spot (spirit) in which it falls is the
understanding in which man has a grip upon the elements around him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you please give us a
complete description, including sights or sounds or sense that happens, in
first preparing for a session, that would include what happens in your ship or
the area that your in, the feelings that Tom may go through, then at the very
beginning of a session, what Tom might see or experience as he’s leaving and
then where he does go and what is happening with his body and then what happens
at the end of a session, when he comes back to the body?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You want that on
lettuce and tomato or over easy? You want us to hold the pickle? The
preparation and the Force-Field in which one enters into what would be
considered the communicate from the Higher Sphere or levels of endowment. One
is in proper alignment within that which would be considered the electrical
fields of north and south, the Polaric is what would be considered the gaining
or the guiding light center within the kocle or the focus point of the guiding
light force-field within the major so-called quote un-quote group. In such said
group or in such relationship of order and consistency in which the circle or
the circuspective ideas and ideals are in communication with. The energy is
then forced or focused into what would be considered the (hudrivenus) or more
or less considered the (shaolitic) shape form energy sphere covering a dome
shape or dominactic shape, system, plantitude, altitude and latitude around
said sphere house center landscape, any other aspect in which the energy
force-field is generating from. The conditions in which we would find the
Higher Spheres or movements or the sphere of movement during the session would
be considered like an electrical impulse vibratory in which the Voltra Light,
or the Blue  Voltra scanning light is put to its highest maximum range of
efficency, pulsating constantly through the membrane and through the fibers
within the physical channel in which the voice structure is then produced and
sounded to be like unto the voice structure of the entity, but in reality it is
the voice structure of the Blue Light, the Blue Light is what is being
reflected in (lineal) form during so called quote unquote communitive or
(healing) or (linistic) more or less the communication between the sphere of
above and below. This Blue Light is what is emanating from the center of the
group or hub center, in this  the Blue Light is the voice and the sound given
previnance and permanence structure within the working order of sound. Sound is
the after-effect in which one receives what  he or she hears and understands,
but in reality he or she is really receiving what would be considered the (Orphanic)
or more or less the Blue Light being radiated or beaming down from that which
is the (cellic) or center point of transmission. The transmission being of Blue
Light energy quasar type effect does and does not have its certain what would
be considered vibration or consistency in the extre or in the exterior
relationship between the physical channel or quote body in which the entity
does and which we do use. The (generative) gyro in which a session is in
complete form, true to form is that the gyro is in a perfect dictorium type
aspect between the stars of Polaris and Orpheus, in this the group or sub-hub
group consciousness must emanate a Green Light, Green Light, if the Green
Light, Light does not emanate to its strongest capacity there is no compass
sator in the relationship of sound and the communication between and the
fulfillment of the Blue Light, Light. In such condition there is what would be
considered a stagnant form of communication in which the Blue Light, Light
communicated to you on a subconscious level and not bringing it into a
condition of consciousness. Only when this Green force field is emanating to
its strongest capacitor, being that you are all  little tubes quote little
tubes, in which each one generates and raises certain energy which enables the
communication of the Blue Light in its syndrome of moving on into its complex
capacities of this what would be considered a session. The conditions in which
the entity perceives is only that of the best rejuvenation, in which the cellular
structures are rejuvenated to its full capacity, in that the Blue Light,  Light
travels through the physical cells giving essence and glow of essence that the
inner force might radiate and become strong to enable the workload factor that
needs to be still produced in the weeks or days to come after the encounter of
the so called session. The reaction is then prescribed, the outcome is then
recorded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The Green Light that this
group has to become before a good session can take place, what is the Green? The
Green to us means healing, is that the same kind of Green or is it something
else that has to take place?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: A Green Light
emanates from what would be considered the bile, more or less the pancreas
section of the body. When it is time or in accordance to receive a so-called
session each tube or center member is generating a certain vibration that
emanates from the pancreas and bile section considering that which is a
Green-Yellow color coming out to be Emerald Green in which generates the
resussitude and force of communication to be hooked up and completed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When we Chant, is that the
color we create then?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Chanting is only
awakening the pancreas and the bile area.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is that correct that Green
is healing? Is it the same Green?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It would be correct.
It would give you the explanation of the so-called heat energy raised in and
traveling throughout the room is only the after-effect of tuning and opening up
that particular door of the Green Light.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: We open it ourselves or is
it open because the Green Light?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is opened through
a condensational form of resesitude vibrations and that of the certain signals
that is heard on a subconscious level triggering that door to be opened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is there any other tubes
like that within this body, within our bodies that are being (try send) off for
the positive while things are happening?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This happens before
the Ark and before that of the Forces of Meditation. It is considered the Gold
Light, Light that generates from the Pineal and moves on and filters into the
Thyroid and Thymus generating a Pink-Red Light that heals and calms the outer
structure. The nervous system is surrounded within the back four spaces high
above medulla oblongaton, the Yellow Light, Light in which a spiral shape aspect
is hovering over what would be considered the Solar Plexus, considering this to
be the Red-White Light, in such a when one unit is generating perfectly during
the Force of Meditation and the one next to them is generating the same, then
the energy becomes bigger and bigger and no longer is the physical body
contained in that particular room but then generates on to next dimension.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is there anything for the
color Blue?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is the
expression of air, breath, the incense in which is received during certain
services, inspire the Blue Light, Light to enter within the nostrils and the
mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When that Blue Light is
generated through a service with the incense does it correspond in any way
shape or form to that Blue Light that creates that condition of a session?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This would be
considered almost the same.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Then that Blue Light that
is created is not created by us that is created by you?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is sent down
through Quasar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now when we think about
Faith, what color does Faith generate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Faith generates a
Emerald Green.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Then is that one of the
highest colors that a human being can bring forth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is one of a high
color combination. A high color is Pure White.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And that only comes when
the Christ Spirit takes over?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Dedication and
Sacrifice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Session (?)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell me some
more about the magnetic stones in the Mayan land that the Atlanteans used?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: These stones gave
life to those who need that of a healing power within them. It was placed in an
L shaped fashion amidst the chest. In so doing it enlightened and gave the
heart energy to heal the internal wounds. It was the hearts function at that
time to heal, taking in consideration that of the appendix, in which the
appendix is stored the healing cells for every organ in the body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: If the appendix is removed
from a person does it still hold true that it will remove the healing cells
from the body? Does that still have that function today?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is the appendix
that stores up bacteria from the physical body, and transmits it into the
astral world. It is the spleen that has the function, as spoken by this entity,
to create that of all natural astral forces of life from the fourth dimension.
The spleen takes on that energy and transmits it through the body, and this is
that transmitted through the centers. The appendix happens to be a secondary
vehicle or a third vehicle of a container. Its function is only to contain the
discarded cells, or discarded materials on a physical, spiritual level that no longer
can bear fruit and become poisonous to the body. This then is discarded in the
appendix. It is also discarded through the forms of a system. But the spleen is
the one that gives the life force or building force, not the appendix. It is
the spleen that takes the energy or what would be called prana energy, using
this energy transmits it to the lower, or the centers of the lower in red, in
dark red, in orange, in green, to the heart is yellow. The blood system is
yellow. To the upper throat is light violet to pale blue. To the upper centers
is violet to very pastel. To the nervous system is red. All these are
transmitted through the spleen. When this operation is taken out, the
individual can only receive its life-forces from those who are called healers.
Healers are those around the individual who have ample enough, ample supply of
extra energy coming through the pores and  saturating the aura. It is this that
a person is known as a light hearted person, or is known as a life giver, and
it is through the presence of that person that others around receive on a
spiritual level healing for their centers, their centers taking them and
distributing it through the cellular structure of the body. This is how the
spleen is important, and doctors should be made aware that is to all costs;
spleen should not be removed, for it creates the person who does not have a
spleen to depend upon others for its energy. The spleen is the doorway for the
spiritual or astral world in which it receives and disperses the energy throughout
the body</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is a growing
concern for us. It represents the nations of the world. It will take time for
that to express and manifest into its fruitful place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Wouldn't it be just three,
the same as with Jesus?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It would be an
interesting discussion on that, as three would have made it at that time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is Joseph included in the
three or not?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Laban wasn't a son.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Laban was the one who
had what would be considered a clean heart. He was the pure aspects that each
one strives for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: He was the father&#8209;in&#8209;law
of Jacob, right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Nonetheless, the
brother of Rebekah. This is the clean spirit that would fulfill and succeed the
making. Also, it represerrts  part of the entity's name. But now, you have Dan
and you have the two sons of Joseph, making what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So it's Joseph, Judah, is
one, Laban is two, and the two sons of Joseph is three, and Dan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I see. What nation would
Laban represent?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The psychic nation..</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So actually, what he did
to Jacob he had to do...the fourteen years and all that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So, actually he was
working with those things we've been talking about: fears and all that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Even though Jacob's name
was changed to Israel and he did reach another consciousness , nevertheless he
was at the same consciousness as his forefathers?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So, in reality, from the
time of Abraham to the time of Jacob...or I mean Joseph, there was only one
that made it through?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Were our deductions about
who Laban is this life time correct?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The entity Laban. We
find the name Laban in his particular lifetime very much in influence with the
situation around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was Laban Merlin?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We would find it of
the same pattern. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Why is it...If you
say...Sometimes you answer immediately yes, no, and other times you don't. What
is the difference?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The difference is the
question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You mean certain questions
are not to be answered?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: What particular
question do you want answered?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: A lot of questions, but in
this particular case, was the entity Tom Laban?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You should have asked
it in that respect. We find your deductions and your assumptions and your
questions correct. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So actually that force of
Laban...Who was he at the time of Jesus then? I mean, we know it was Thomas,
but yet only three made it, and Thomas was one of those three. At the time of
Jacob it seems as if though four made it including Laban.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Laban was not
incorporated into the three (3). It was above the three (3). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And at the time of Jesus?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You need an extra
help and push wherever you can get it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was there another one
besides Thomas, John, and Philip who made it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That should be it for
the moment. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Who was he?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Who was what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The fourth. The one that
was above the three. The one that represented the same thing as Laban
represented at the time of Jacob. Who was the magician?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Joseph Arimathaea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But yet Joseph Arimathaea
was not Laban?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So actually Merlin, Laban,
it's really one force...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: That has nothing to do with
the evolution of the entity?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: One force tapping
into that channel. Once tapped into, goes through a progression and centers.
Laban was associated in Merlin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But yet not necessarily
the entity that manifested as Merlin would be the same...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Merlin was Laban.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And Joseph Arimathaea, who
was he at the time of Laban?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let us say the twin
aspect of Thomas.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The twin aspect. The
brother of Laban?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The aspect of the
soul.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Oh. Thank you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now there is somewhere
said that Thomas went with Jesus to Japan. Is that correct?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is accurate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But he came back before
his ministry?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is accurate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You answered already my
second question? Is that correct? The one I didn't complete?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: During the time of
the crucifixion and prior to it, Jesus, Thomas, John left to go to India and
Japan. While Jesus was in Japan, he transmigrated his body to Calvary, being in
Japan and on Calvary at the same time, dying for all physical awareness in
Calvary and transporting it from Japan to Cavalry. John, Thomas helped Jesus
disappear and left them stranded, returning back by ship finding out that Jesus
died, which was a shock to Thomas who could not believe it. And you know the
rest of that story.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So that that he has a
grave in Japan...if I understand correctly, he died actually simultaneously in
Japan, too?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So, he actually...was
there any other place where he died simultaneously? Or is it just Japan?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is what would be
called not to be answered at the moment. This is enough for you to handle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: That's why Thomas had such
a hard time believing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you. But John
didn't.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Did John transmigrate,
too, since he was at the foot of the cross?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: John came back in a
different form like unto the Revelation. Thomas was the only one that then,
what would be called then, came back by boat. Remember, Thomas and John went to
India. But it was Thomas that went to Japan alone. It was John that left Japan,
leaving Jesus and Thomas in Japan alone. At that time John returned at that
moment to be with the whole institute. It is strange. All those was there. The
correlation of the time element for the Last Supper was that which is the
Garden of Gethsemane. And all apostles were there, for they came and went in a
different form Thomas was not present in the form we know it at the Last
Supper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Then Tom...then Thomas
could have also done the same thing in coming to the cross. Why didn't he? Or
did he?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Because or that which
is burying of the body this particular time. Fear, grief, shock. But this
travelling was not a normal boat travelling. He traveled at greater speed
because of a wind in back of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But he wasn't at the
crucifixion, Thomas?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: In a form, yes. This
is what made him come late for he came to understand. This is what makes it
complicated for you all to understand. For this whole segment of the
crucifixion was the ultimate in the play. And in the ultimate of plays,
everything seems to be happening all at once.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Then when Jesus said to
John, &quot;You take care of my mother,&quot; or something to that effect, he
really wasn't talking to John, but to a spirit of John. Or to, as you said, a
Revelation, which means to you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: He was talking to
John physically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was Mary also taken up?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How long afterwards?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: A period of twenty&#8209;two
or what would be called two years, two months.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Why isn't there any
mention about it in the Bible?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is interesting not
to worry about that. So much is not mentioned in the Bible, that if it was
people would not even think of it to believe in Jesus any more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You mean it wouldn't suit
what we...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: All the predictions that
Jesus has made in Chapter Twenty&#8209;four of Matthew, have they already come
true? Or is it now?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is an evolution of
the spiritual development of mankind that will take millenniums for it to be
accomplished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So things are happening in
our generation, too. That means pretty quick.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The Second Coming that was
talked about so much, will this be the final coming for the entity Jesus?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It would be the final
coming for the old pattern.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Then Jesus will be for
many more...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: It's a fulfillment of a
stage of development?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So actually the earth is
in what then? In its first stage then?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: New stage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But since the beginning as
we know it till Jesus time there was nobody like Jesus or that brought forth
this kind of thing for millions after himself to carry on or to...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Remember, Jesus is
the sum total of everyone's cooperation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Yeah. And there was nobody
else that was a sum total of everybody's cooperation before him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Not to that
particular extent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So, if he's the finishing
of or of one point and since this is the only point we know of from the Bible
or from anywhere that we can know, is it like the first stage? And there will
be like more stages...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: ...of development?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct. Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Will it be in the physical
form? Or will there no more be a physical form?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When Jesus went...I have
two questions about the cruci­fixion, and about the time that he was dead, I
guess. When he was underneath. Was that...was it...what was the relationship of
James, Jesus brother to that situation, to the crucifixion?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: James was involved
with the crucifixion also.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was it him, his body that
was up on the cross?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We would put it into
this other type of state­ment. It was a projection force&#8209;field that they
were working on. It was to sway that which is the negative and positive
electrons around the human body to prevent the degration or that of the decay
of it. James had a very important role in preserving the physical body during
the three days of entombment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was he in the physical
body what we call alive at that point?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Which one?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The brother.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The entity of James
or of Jesus?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: James.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes. Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Oh. So it was like in the
creation? Matter pushing other matter. Creating a barrier of some sort?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Causing a wall
between that which is and that which isn't. Protective force.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And that's...that gave
Jesus the time that he needed to do whatever he had to do to bring up that body
or to protect that body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Also to bring up
other souls and spirits in the earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Did Jesus go down into the
earth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And he actually took like
a key of some type from the devil to unlock the dimensional doors?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could You tell us more
about what Jesus was doing, what was happening the three days that he wasn't on
the earth after His crucifixion?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: He went into the
middle earth to see the kings of the place to bring a new law of love,
patience, cooperation, forgiveness, tolerance, and faith. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Did He have a battle with
Lucifer or Satan in the middle of the earth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes and no. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How did He get the keys to
let the people out?</span></p>

Catarina know that they have a manuscript that was written by Jesus himself?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>There was no Tape recorder
present at this Session, nor was […] there. The following is a transcription of
R’s notes, in which she only tried to record the answers of the Forces. The
questions are reconstructed from memory.]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Can you tell us anything
about Jesus’s visit to the Americas? And is the Book of Mormon accurate
concerning this?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: He did travel to
America, India, Japan, Tibet, South America, and Australia, The information
contained in the Book of Mormon was received and guided. Jesus was roughly
twenty-­five to twenty&#8209;nine years of life. The Mormons didn't record it,
an Indian recorded it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was Jesus the entity known

this legend of the tree that... dogwood?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Dogwood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Dogwood...that the cross
was made out of that tree for Jesus crucifixion. And since that time, that tree
doesn't grow, or it grows crooked. Is that an accurate?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We say that that
particular tree was used by Moses staff. We also say it was used in a major
part of a spiritual law and order. But all houses that have a dogwood in front
of them are in its possession that those are the souls that are in prospective
understanding and advancing to a spiritual plateau. It is a sign on the
spiritual level of the angels.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Like the blood of the
lamb?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What wood, then, was used
for Jesus cross?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, we would say a
combination, but you had a group of cedar and that which would be close.
Therefore, let us say dogwood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you. Then the
dogwood is not really growing crooked. It is growing as it always grew. It only
may look crooked on this dimension.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Have I had any relations

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Three of these
children were in the Temple of Beautification. And as said as such in which you
had control to work with them. One of the children or the souls you were in­volved
with during the period of the French Revolution, also during the period in

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Ten&#8209;O&#8209;eight

Atlantis? Was he like Melchizedek?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let us say Merlin, as
his name is known to you, was a magician simple doctor of the earth, who did
that which the earth atoms dictated for him to do, Melchizedek was also of the
same but a higher order of vibration in parts and it was a priestly concern in

Merlin's imprisonment in a rock be given? What really happened and is it
related to the forces asleep on the island of Britain?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let us say it was the
imprisonment of the spirit for those who do not want to listen. When the spirit
is turned off and not received, then it is put into a state of Epiletic process
and sent into a rock to</span></p>

will they be destroyed?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Some have recovered.

as making ah groundwork or building or ah pushing or forcing the energies, while
the Harp is more of receiving the energies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I’m talking about the
Bards. I’m talking about the Druids, the ones that used the harp that trained
in the use of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No, no, no, no, no
(sigh) (sigh). We’re talking about not only people, ok, we’re talking about
exactly the same thing. One is the ones who pushed or made or created the
energy. The Harp is just a receiving of the energy. Bars, the ones who do the
Harp, the ones who do the music. The ones who do that is a special force, not,
there was a time in which not everyone could do it. So they had to develop
themselves and had to put themselves on special plans. Could you understand
that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Not really.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well take it from us
that’s what happened. And they would, they were energized tremendously, so they
were the pushers or they became or it became the moving of energy force and
breaking, not only physically but also on a astral level.</span></p>

the 7 shepherds and the 8 principle men who shall stand up against the
Assurian. Could you tell me who the shepherds are and the 8 principle men?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well there are
several antidotes or circles of interpretations to this. 7 shepherds represents
those sections within the body that have been consecrated in the performing of
the spiritual mission. Those centers, those centers, those centers that are
revolving around the mission. The 8 principle men can be identified or implied
or explained as the 8 principle men of the world or nations of the world or the
8 qualities within man that need to be worked with. They also could imply the source
of the 8 receiving forces that surround the earth in different shapes sizes and
tones.</span></p>

the, I’ve been reading about the Druids and they seem to worship, they say they
worship Noah and the 8 people in the Ark. Does this relate to ah cube thing and
the octagon at the center. Could you explain how all that works?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well let us say they
worshiped the Laws and the Spirit that was given during that time and that
would,  the working is of the octagon and also the land of ah information and
resources were given. Ah interesting, ah there is a, a, a instrument that was
derived from this. Ah it was from the ah Mohammedan 600 area(?600ad), when they
had astronomy involved. This was the course of Celtic information handed down
in such a way that it found itself in this scope, in which they have a ah triad
of the stars on a flat surface, giving the scales and the numbers of each
constellation. This was handed down from not only Greece and Latin, no not
Latin. The Greek ah histories and what was handed down to the Celtics who were
involved a lot with astronomy.</span></p>

or the octagon how the Druids like thought of it and used it, with the 14
things in the middle?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: More of a
concentrated focus and building aspect. Ah there were many ah Revelations
received by concentrating on the center of this object, during those times. And
they had certain ways of focusing in on it. These are all private sections of
the Druids that could not really be focused in on because they were private and
separate from the world, and the world could not understand them. Almost the
same what this particular group is going through. There is no way you can prove
yourself to the world, as far as system and styles, and it cannot really be
done as much as you would like to have the world accept, the world can never
really accept movement and truth and progress because there is always that
forerunner of ideas that are not readily acceptable at the moment.</span></p>

was?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well there were many
Caldrons as you call it, some were a, was a chair or a open center into a hole
in the earth, in which someone would receive messages from or sit on or a
suspend themselves over. There others would bow upside down to extend themselves
in to receive some sort of Revelation. You have all sorts of different
experiences that were going on. And you have also the flute type, ah , ah
trumpet that people would hear or listen into to receive messages. But these
would give you some explanation (  ) that moment.</span></p>

and a growth of changing things and seeing things in the great picture of
beyond. He moved from dimension to dimension and carried with him the
understanding. People the 4th dimension is before your very eyes. Heaven is
right before you. When you fall in death you fall right into the 4th dimension.
Immediately your body moves, gets cold from the feet and moves on forward up
through the head. The head is the last part in which the spirit of life moves
out. And then everything becomes incorporated into the existence of another
dimension that is actually a real dimension that we go to. It can stand on its
own feet if you seek to do other things it would point out etc, etc, etc. There
are those 4th dimensions, in which are capsulated and in capsulate-ing them it
is called the wind of consciousness or the wind of revealing. Wind comes in the
morning to 6: 07(6 or 7) the latest 6: 20. It is the 4th dimension wind,
reveals all things necessary and if we all go immediately to continue what we
have.</span></p>

Patrick have something to do with the aspect of commitment?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: St. Patrick has an
aspect of driving away those temptational forces within man. That is why the
Irish people are noted tremendously for the amount of energy and that of their
temper. For that which they have is the direct key and foundation of the
covenant; and when it abides by the God or laws from above and when these laws
are broken, then enraged people are set about to correct that which is undone.
Subconsciously, these people are that aspect of the lost tribe that carried the
covenant and protected it through many years. This enabled them to write
creatively for the Higher Forces. This was their inheritance if they abide by
harmony and discipline, rather than by strong drink.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Tarot of course
is involved. We would say the major cards are involved with each personality
and each standard. Of course the different Knights and Kings, sets involved
with the 12 principles or 14 codes. The 14 codes or ways of movement. Of course
the principles here are old and just so that the happens that this has taken
the same stand in its upbringing and movement to that of the Tree of Life and
the codes, the cards of learning. So it could be applied in its own way and
means. Finding the ways and means in time, all is up to the individual and each
one is primal and not stationary as far as its development.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In the tales written about
Arthurian England, and early medeval England, they have all these tales of
Knights running into encounter after encounter, and what appears like fantasy
situation, after situation. So much is written like that, a knight could go out
in the woods for an afternoon, and encounter 47 processions of people going
through the woods, and all sorts of things. What does this really represent,
what is behind all those things happening?</span></p>

many miles down into a crevice in which in time it stayed until it was
rediscovered by ancient monks bringing it to surface and then bringing

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So whoever brings out the
Grail is bringing forth conflict?</span></p>

and joining into a higher consciousness of Christ-hood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And then the others didn't

like the alien population and the man on earth. Were the aliens here first and
then man was here or how does it all fit together.</span></p>

brought them to earth or the garden of Eden.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Earth was the garden of
Eden?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: More so Venus was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So who brought man to
earth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Man as you know him
was created. Man was a beast, an animal form and man was given the spirit so
not that man was brought to earth, but he was illumined in the earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Who did it? The same
one that you call the Christ.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Is he like the
creator?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: He is the mess up.
Man was created as a beast and was never intended to have a spirit. He saw man
suffering under the toil of the earth as a worker and gave him a spirit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was he Adam at that time?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Adam was Adam. He was
Adam.</span></p>

at that point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: He was the first
Adam.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: First Adam. Amilius
meaning?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Same, before Adam.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How many Adam's were
there?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: One. But in the one
were thousands. The call has gone out. Tremendous force.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: At that point in time?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: At this point in this
very moment of time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What kind of a call has
gone out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The call as the
entity has said. It has begun. The vortex starts in front of the Alter and
changes the whole Universe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is the, we talk of aliens
and I'm not sure if this is right. In my mind I see the guidance from the
higher forces is a whole totally different aspect. But the aliens..</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We do work with the
aliens on a different nature. We do communicate with the sister ships we call
them. It does not mean we are involved with them, but under intergalactical
laws and the spiritual foundation, we must be present in all affairs concerning
the issues that deal with the SS's.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What is the name?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Dealing with the
SS's. These are the different serpentinian reptiles and the wokos of the four
nature of the galaxies of the untas. In such a condition, these are the most
powerful forces that are in this area, the most dangerous at the same time we
of the At--n nature have complete distort and what would be called incorporated
their distortions into what would be in linement of the illius&#8209;ottos. In
this particular compenance and in this fear of eckloctos intoome evotos. In
such a element is to the supreme force of energy, this is our control.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The aliens that brought
man to earth, that's not really the aliens, that's you or that's another level.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We are again the
overseer of this whole play. It is not of our doing. But the one that have a
implementation of such a contract was of a kindly nature.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now the aliens then to be
regarded as something more evolved either being wise or technologically or
something more than that of a divine nature. Are we talking simply higher
evolution or divine nature or is that the same thing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Their divine nature
is not as imminent and as progressive as man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So there is not a
sacredness to them. It is more just an evolution of a higher level?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Which one's are we talking
about, the reptilians or which ones. I'm very confused with this whole thing.
With It sounds like there are more than, there are quite a few of them but there
are quite a few good and quite a few not so good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There are five that
are not that great. Which we are overseeing and controlling but not getting
involved. There are 44 total around the earth and the galaxies of the earth
proper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Out of those 44; five are
not good. Are there that are right down evil?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The five that are not
so good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now, even those five. You
have the right to be at the table there with them so to speak. At the
conference or I don't know what to call it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Sister ships.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You still call them sister
ships even though they are not so good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We are nice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In the Book of Solomon it
talks about the 5 accursed nations, are these like the 5 alien races?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Do they go along with the 
5 races of man?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well let us say they
are the attributes of these alien (…).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So each alien has a
different race he affects?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Which would be the one for
the white race?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It would be the
Talls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the Reptillian are the
Chinese?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>[…]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So, if I would speak in a
language, the only one I can comprehend is the SCI&#8209;if, shall we call it
lets say a galactic or a universal, I don't know what, but you are the
observers of everybody and everything and therefore you have to be at all the
conferences so to speak? And I oversimplifying? I don't know how to..</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No conference gets
into conference without our being.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Okay. So that is correct?
The way I am understanding?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Go ahead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So now, you oversee and
you have the right to interject but you don't have the right to negate
completely? Because.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We do have a certain
force of operation when they offer a violation of the law we follow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Okay. But they have as
many rights as the rest of the 44, as the rest of the 39. Everybody is
following certain laws and you are sort of, no not the police, you are not the
police. There is a police force what we would consider a police force, but you,
that works for you. Is that correct?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No. They don't work
for us. We are simply where we are at, overseeing. But we are not the force of
judgment or law or order. That should be sufficient for the moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: That there has to be a
force like that because who has then if somebody breaks some of those rules or
whatever it is that you are speaking of.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is by the rules
that are broken. The rules themselves take discipline.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Oh my God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Question?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Then when we refer to
Black Force are we referring to those five groups of aliens?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Now remember, the
black forces is your way of explaining this energy. But it is an energy field.
Not that they are negative, but hostile some, yes; to certain things. But for
us to explain the whole gamut what is out there, will only make you contused,
nervous, jittery and Alka&#8209;seltzer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But in praying, is it that
we pray to the aliens that brought us here, we pray at your level, we pray to a
level higher than your level.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Your prayers are
connecting yourselves to your soul. Or to your higher level that must be done
in order to safeguard your identity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And our Higher level is at
what point in relation to all these levels of beings?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Little lower than the
Angel. But much higher that anything that has ever been created than the
angels.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And the Angels stand at
what place in relation to the level of these beings?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Angels are the
Angels. They are the servants. the being’ s are interactions with them. Levels
are Levels. But man and woman on the earth stands above all this which
challenges the gods.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Then when we say gods, we
mean at what level?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Levels of creation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But there is a one God
that this connects to at a higher level than all this?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: I don't think you can
pin this on one person.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(Laughter)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Because there was earlier
sessions where it was said that we too must bow to the will of the highest, the
one god. That was said in earlier sessions, several times. So then what was
being referred to?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We are not disputing
that. We are just saying you cannot pin man's creation onto one god.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But those are the words of
a session, so the session was referring to whom or to what.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: What would you say it
to be referring to?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In order for there to be
harmony in the universe as I understand it this moment which may change 5
seconds from now depending on what you might say or what I might think, it
would be something higher that all must conform to some law and some way in
order to keep some order in the universe. There must be some higher force or
being..</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: And that is the Being
that we speak about that all order and all action, and the action itself if it
breaks the law of this particular law of the, then that law itself becomes
activated by the breaking of it. This comes from that force or supreme force.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Then if I say a rosary and
I call on the force of Mary, what am I calling on? What level, where is that
and this..</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Remember, you are
dealing with your soul at that point. So you are creating a mantra around your
soul and bringing your energy of your force of your soul down into the earth
body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And where does my soul
stand in relation to all these higher hierarchies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Again, you are a
threat because you have the spirit within given to you. And therefore you are
above the Angels and of course when you were created, you challenged the
galaxies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So man now is a little
lower than the Angel..</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: But higher than the
Angels.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But eventually has the
capacity to be higher than the Angels?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: And also is the big
enigma of the galaxies. All life as we know it on all planets look to the
earth. This is strange. We would say who would want to bother with the earth.
But because of your nature of being beasts, of being the ability to have
procreation of the mental mind, of the soul within the mental body and the body
itself, you are a component highly versatile, highly tuned and above all
expectations that were ever devised to be made.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now, we are all of that
but we were solely brought into a beast form in the earth. But that is what
that action created?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Unfortunately or
fortunately, yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now out of those 5 alien
races, is any of them or all of them together or none of them. Or is it a
separate thing, that force that we call..</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They all work as a
team and have other ships that they all go together. They all work together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: the Five? (pause) Those
five work together? (pause) Those five work together?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Excuse us, we are
trying to deal with something. Have a little respect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Oh, I am sorry. (pause)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There is a need that
the information that we are giving you does not come forth. Therefore certain
other extra energy fields we're trying to alter the force coming in. Of course.
it could not have that effect. Now we are ready for your questions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you. Those five, are
they different, the same or as what we call Lucifer, Satan or is this..</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, lets just leave
it. There is no question the reptilians could and can be identified as Satan
and Lucifer all broken down in the different categories. But there are those
grays that work and on and on and on. But we have to understand that the evil
one is also used for that which will eventually down the road be for the
purpose. And that will eventually be changed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you. Also, from
these 44 alien races, none of them can procreate?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, No, No, No, no,
we are not saying that. Some of them can't do it because of an evolution hang
up and change. But we are not saying that. We are merely saying that we have
the corner in that market. Not us but you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Right, Is that the most
desirable thing then? Procreation?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No, no, no we never,
no, no, no, no, no, no, we are, we didn't say that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So then, what we pose as
an enigma is because we have a soul, a higher self.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is so, it is so
much to speak to you about, yet to do it fast or all in one moment we have
spoke to you for many, many sessions. We are trying to keep it as concised, and
as conserved in its informational text, but at the same time, your questions
are very important for your understanding the concepts. The concepts are very
confusing and we do not blame you for being frustrated with understanding it.
But at the same time, we want to give the opportunity to share information that
is good and accurate and not complicated, confusing and totally, totally
disengaging of what you might know up to this point in our sessions for over
years. Everything ties in together. Some more, some less. But know is the time
for us to be open, frank, expedient, and deliver to you what you need.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Session 615</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you. Are these
aliens the sons of god mentioned in the bible that married the daughters of
men?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Those are some of
them, yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And you had mentioned in
previous sessions how man was like a role model in their evolution for the
elements of the earth. If man prevails in its evolution and holds fast to what
we have gained so far and continue to evolve, will the aliens eventually learn
from that and evolve or will they just never cease until, or will they never
cease until they stop or die? Is there any chance that they will evolve?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They are bewildered
and perplexed and amazed with the spiritual attribute of man's ability to pray.
They do not understand prayer. And man doing it perplexes them because it is an
energy field that is produced they do not understand. Yes, they are evolving
just by getting in touch and involved with man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is it because we, man, has
slowly grown from the beast and then slowly been guided up while perhaps were
not in the beast stage so they never felt the need for prayer?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They were not created
to understand that. They were more mental in their application and in being
mental they do not understand the soul or spirit. Therefore, clue &#8209;
answer. Gravitate more to the spirit and the soul. Conquer all that is around
you. this is the course. If you stay on the spirit and prayer and the spiritual
road rather than the mental road; the mental road decays and falls to the
spiritual road. The mental road becomes the spiritual road. Therefore if you
take the spiritual road, offset by prayer and meditation and chanting and
singing, then you will be at the place where you need to be without doing the
work extra or the mental. the mental succumbs to the spiritual; the mental
always leads to the spiritual confirmation. So, jump on to the spiritual and it
will catapult you to where you need to be meaning you will be at the best place
at the right place at the right time without that much effort.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Ruben lost his birthright,
and it was given to Joseph. Could you explain what it means in the bible when
it says that Judah became first among his brethren because he prevailed on them
and why did that happen?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is speaking of
the birthright of the spirit, the soul, the incarnate or the soul level of the
birthright is given. One looses it when one A) does not keep anchored to the
novitiate or to the teacher or to the advarter. This is the soul connection for
the purpose and when the birthright is lost the link between that spiritual
force hook up effects other generations down the line. Not necessarily the one
lost it, but the effect of it has a ripple</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: If man was on Venus, what
was happening on the earth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It was not the in
place, it was not the in spot and there were no night clubs. Venus was the most
active place and became more like the vacation place of the galaxies. And then
it no longer was in favor and they made then man on earth which became the
vacation spot of the world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Do any of these 44 have
souls?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: For the sake of not
confusing you, yes and some no. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Okay, so it is a different
evolution. Its just a different type of thing altogether.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Were they here forever or
did they converge on this earth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, they were
converging and they were elsewhere. Question?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Do I understand that
Talbot as being the 49?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Question?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The name Talbot in
representing the 49.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Do I understand there are
actually 44 plus the 5?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: 49 all together then
really.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Who gave us the gift of
the feather. What was the name of the force. They gave us the gift of the
feather.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let us just say the
Angels did. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The five bad ones. Each
one attacks a different sense, of the five senses?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are you then a whole
separate thing besides the 49?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We don't eat at
McDonalds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We are not of the 49,
but we are of the 49. question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Any of those 49 that are
native to this earth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No, question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And you also, are you
using man to kind of lure these beings so that they can be evolved?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You are the
counterpart of changing the whole evolution of everything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are there any other
universes with earth's and free will?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let us just say this,
this hasn't happened anywhere! question</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is it an 18 day course?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We would like to say
we wish it could be. question. There are some aliens that still are trying to
figure you out and catch up to you. being that you are an emotional in nature,
no is guaranteed and nobody ever will. question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Do any of them have rights
over people here on the earth since some of them abduct people? How do they get
away with it since breaking a law would automatically put them in a bad, in
punishing mode.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, its kind of a
human being question. And being a human being (bean) it kind of jumps up and
down. they are not held accountable because were you had come from was worse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: For those who get abducted
you mean.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: If they abduct you
and you decry not to and to leave, by the law of the galaxies, then that is the
cry. question?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So does mean that if they
abduct you and you say this is not what I want, they are at fault?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, let us say the
sister ships do take and we do watch and we talk and we try to counsel them to
decry that decry and to innately put into them. But sometimes they figure that
these aliens are good brothers to them and make them gods. Then we have no
other alternative but to mind our business. question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What is the cry?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Declare! question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Do I understand that the
letters, the 22 letters can be like double that to get 44, each letter for a
person who knows can tune into each one of those 44 of the letters of the
Hebrew alphabet?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When you say this hasn't
been done anywhere, has it been tried?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No, no, no it has
not. What is happening here on the earth was a god that came and gave you the
spirit. That was never, never supposed to be done. And that was Elohim, and
that was Yahweh, and that was those gods, that got involved and we could go on
and on but remember you have many names of God. each name of God is this might
go back to your original question is there one God? Each name of God is a god
force of that particular entities of gods that operate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And all of these gods,
that was Jesus Christ, one of them. Is that who gave us the soul? that you said
in this session?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That was the
underlying focal point in heritage and gods of the distance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Why did her do it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: What?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What was his reason? or
was there are reason. Why did he give us a soul?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: (Hands are being
extended as is the gesture of a question)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: No body knows?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We still today watch
them go (extends hands again). At this point we will have to leave. We will
speak to you again soon. Greetings to all here present now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you. With this
people that are the top part of the world government, the one's that allow all
this and the one's that are in contact with the aliens, where is their humanity
at this point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: To see other
civilizations on the planet Mars develop, and persevere for the preservation of
humanity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So they have, they think
they are being idealistic?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They think they are
being realistic by getting the top notch people off the earth on to another
planet to cultivate, and high qualities of beings to get rid of the inferior
beings on the earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But, doesn't that still
come from us? Just basic humanity? Basic love?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Unfortunately, that
is outdated. That is old hat. Those concepts do not work for the superior man
to come.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is there a superior man
that is coming.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They believe
genetically, intelligently, superior mentally, have been weaned off the earth
and placed on Mars.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Couldn't they have Mars
and leave Earth alone?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No, because they need
to wipe the earth clean and repopulate it with these superior races to come.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: People in the government
that are involved in this, do they think they are going to be chosen?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, they feel that
by being involved in it, they are already chosen. question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you. But they can be
eliminated just as easily.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, at anytime.
question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So Mars is an incubator?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Cal! it what it is.
The point is the aliens as they are fighting among themselves, our own
governments, fighting for supremacy; its an unbelievable mess.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you. You said in the
last session that this property is on one of the mystery schools? Could you
explain that? Is that under the ground.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is the starting of
the school from the beginning. And it is on the ground itself with its own
evolution.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the etheric energy of
this property is..</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That too, yes. Also
the electromagnetic fields and the lines of work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So, the aliens. Their real
hope is to get back their worker beasts and to destroy those with spirit?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: More or less.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In earlier sessions, you
talked about the souls being as souls hovering over the earth and then getting
involved in materiality. And in the last session, you talked about the beast
forms that the souls were brought into by the one who we call the Christ, how
do those two reconcile?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We don't understand
your question?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: There was two different
forms that were given to how we got involved in physical forms in the earth.
One was we were souls on an etheric or higher level and we became involved in
materiality by constant experimenting, etc.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Exactly, it was the
DNA changes within the beast. The DNA structure was taken out of the souls.
They were superior element under distant galaxies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So we interfered with the
DNA structure of the beast body and came into it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Repeat?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: We interfered with the DNA
structure that was in the beast bodies and then entered them?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: WE?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Well, it said that we came
into, the souls came into the, that are in the earth came into the beast bodies
that were here. maybe I misunderstand it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: WE?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I don't understand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: What do you mean by
WE?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You said that we; it
talked of us as being souls in the earth that were brought into beast bodies by
the one we call the Christ. So I am trying to understand that they both mean
the same thing, its just..</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The element of the
soul was taken by the angels and through that of Adam the spirit of light was placed
within the beasts of the earth, of burden, illuminating his soul and
conscientiousness by the changing of the deep sleep and his DNA structure
creating a soul within the beast. The souls were taken out of a lineage, a line
of a superior force that completely altered and changed the plans of the gods.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now, our souls that were
existence in a life prior to coming into this level?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The souls were of an
existence of an element of a superior force of the best qualities of these
force; altering and entering into the structure of the beast of burden,
sabotaging the plans of the gods, altering it for the creation and duration of
eternity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And in saying the plans of
the gods you mean who as the gods.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yahweh, Elohim,
Sabboath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And these are at what
level in relation to, is this you or a different level or being entity from
what you are.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We are the humble
watchers of this play that is working out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: On the 8th dimension you
talked about before in another session how ships ( ? ) the host, I was thinking
that when it comes down to this level and appears metallic, does that mean all
elements on this level on the 8th dimension since there are 144 perfect
elements, that means they’re host on the 8th dimension, they’re like host.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well let us say yeah,
yes they’re, they have the Deity&#8209;ship ( ? ).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you help me
understand the 144 spiritual elements talked about a long time ago and how they
appear in this dimension as related to the higher dimensions?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well they appear in
the genetic structure as far as your DNA structure, that is one part of the
144,000. DNA structure is not completely finished for there are 3 offshoots
that will be found to explain the missing genetic structure of diseases. There
is a 2 bead bolus on the northeast side of one directly south of it and a third
one that shoots from the south one to the right. These are the 3 extra
findings, sections where to look to find another type of hereditary or
intelligent beings that is in man, that will soon develop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are these like connected
with the missing elements on the periodic chart?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Missing element is a
whole different concept and there will be found a few more missing elements as
time goes on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What is it that resides in
the DNA molecule?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The spirit resides in
the DNA molecule.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The complete universe
without the blessing of God?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you please tell me
about platelets, what their signification is on a spiritual level and why
lately it seems like I’ve been getting all sorts of information about them or
people have been talking to me about them?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Platelets are the
backbone of the blood cell and it is in this that the blood has its strength
and energy. They are to find that also the nucleus is not Just the electrons
and protons, the nucleus of the atom, but their is within the nucleus the
center of atom that scientists will discover is the true soul of the DNA
structure. And it is in this that will unleash a great deal of knowledge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The substance that is
within the nucleus of a cell, is it the same of which the soul is made?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Scientists will begin
to understand that the nucleus is not the nucleus of a cell that their is a new
center in the cell, their just too stupid to find it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The center within a cell is
that the same as the Ring Pass Me Not?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, you could
compare it to such, yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The center within the cell
that is obviously not the nucleus, is it associated with one of the things that
has a name in scientific terms, is it the Mitochrondia?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, I N 11 let it be
it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Do the 22 letters go along
with the a, like I was reading about, the 22 amino acids? Does it correspond to
that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, of course.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So in the beginning of
Genesis that’ what there talking about?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Among other things,
they are also talking about this factor too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What does the center, the
nucleic acid represent in the center of the cell?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This represents the
soul essence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Does it represent the
higher, like the high letters?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Of course it represents
this pattern or plane. If you take one of those elements, centers out you would
have the whole structure for another body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So this is when it says in
the Bible not to tamper with that, the Laws, not to profane the ah central
point? You should never tamper with the cells in the body?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Of course. Well, it
can get out of hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is there or were there
such a thing as Genies in bottles or out of them?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There are still
Genies in bottles, what do you think I am. All you have to do is rub the right
place. Our ship mechanisms operate on such a system. Genies in bottles
represent those what would be called the genetical side or the (gene&#8209;y&#8209;side)
which was their original names when they came to earth. All those who did see
them in India thought they were Genies in bottles. In fact they came from a
ship or space craft that was made out of pure cylindical glass substance.
Raising from them the power and vapors which produced them and projected them
from the space&#8209;craft. Very important information I give you. People at
that particular time asked &quot;Who art thou&quot;? and they &quot;We are
Genies&quot;, which was the name that they were originally specified or their
species were named &quot;Genie Afeytus&quot;, or&quot; the One named Genie, or
the &quot;genes of the One&quot;, or &quot;the cells of One&quot;, or &quot;the
Cells of the Elo&quot;, or &quot;the Cells of One.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When you are saying
&quot;we&quot; your talking about your own, you right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Creation of many
parts and faculties of us.</span></p>

was told that if one knew the secret code of the DNA structure one could use
that and call back the body after it had died, and the Egyptians were trying to
do it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This DNA structure is

beads is the word of God?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Each bead represents
a certain atomic structure of the elements.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But the whole triangle
represents the name Jehovah?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct. The eye of

the real name of God?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is part of His
Names. The name of God one cannot even speak in your language. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In the <u>TREE OF LIFE </u>book
there's one of the verses that says, &quot;Tetragramaton, thou made us in thy
mind.&quot; Who was Tetragramaton? Could you explain the verse?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Tetragramaton

him?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Partially.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And at one point you said
to us years ago when you described the table around which you sat in the ship
through which things were beamed to us that we too, who ever was in the room I
guess at that time or whatever, had sat at that table. Then in what form had we
also been at that table?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The form in which we
beamed you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: From the earth and brought
us to the ship for that moment in time?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: From the beam to the
earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So we were brought into
the earth from that point?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The stones in the
breast-plate. Did each of the twelve stones function individually or did they
each have an individual purpose or are they in groups of three or did they
allow like some... were they for protection or channeling the energy or did
they all have the same function?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The stones on the
breast plate are vibrational energy fields that were set for the control and
focus of discernment. In discernment was the focusing of the pattern of light
while the development of the vibration of light, the energy of fractions. these
fractions had a focus and demanding sphere of influence in projecting the
energies of tomorrow. They all have a fracturing sequence. and each light or
stone represented an element of alien power. these were the 12 guardians of the
alien power. those are the force of the different plates in conjunction to that
purpose and power of the establishment of earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you. So these were
all good, none of these were having to do with the five?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They were in
subsequent order and reflector of the 5</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You mean they bounced the
five off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They complemented the
five.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But they weren't the same
side, the five bad ones.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It was used to the
complement of the total.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So they would kind of
reach out. What..</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They just joined in,
in its focus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The five bad ones were?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Greetings to all here present
now.  We are in this area and find that lots (?) of mountain of work has been
accomplished.  In seeing the different wars that are abounding in the galaxies
beyond the Earth, we find the interesting effect of a galactical attack and
invasion of the starlight frontier.  In all these years we have prepared you
for the moment.  It is with this event that those who have been here thousands
of years ago are now back.  We have watched them and in their futile attempt
they have entered the areas of your Earth.  What is, what has been, what will
be, are all of the questions that needs to be addressed.  In so doing, we find
that the addressing of the events of change on this Earth has come to be. 
We’ve watched the comings and the goings and wars that have endured around your
Earth.  It is on this particular day we enter in to speak to you clearly and
without any provocations of thought.  Knowing that in so doing that many days
have gone by in seeing and progressing to this moment.  As in all that is done
there has been and will be the bridge and the destroyer.  The attack has been
ongoing in many different sections.  This is the wayward a war ship and the
wayward a Dutch ship of the North has now entered into the space.  The wayward
Dutch ship is of a arcstellar constellation of M24.  They have violated the
space of travel and once again have been and is back from the visits of Moses
time.  They are now back.  Strange as it might seem, the people of the Earth
are being prepared for this news.  There are crop circles being inscribed
periodically in this West Coast for signs and delivery of the moment.  Many
crop circles have been recorded and noted in England, France, Holland,
Netherlands.  But strange as it is, none has been noted on your West Coast.  Oh
drastic moment.  Oh drastic time.  This has been noted and erased from vision. 
There is a team that enters in and when the crop circles appear, immediately
the radiation group of this country goes into action and calls it a radiation
spill, blocking off the area from which it is found.  Therefore, know that this
point all radiation spills are not to cause colliding together but a crop
circle that had landed on its backside.   Knowing of all of these things, this
cleanup campaign eradicates the sites of the time, the signals from the
visitors, so those who see them are on special missions and scouts to eradicate
them up and down the West Coast.  We find that many times there are changes. 
Changes that are so drastic that by going through them you will never be the
same.  It is going through this Earth that we become more intuned to what we
are.  Who we are.  Where we are.  It is true that many things people tried to
cover, but the major information of these circles have been camouflaged by this
secret troupe called the CSTRG, the Crop Circle Radiation Group Training. So,
it is their job, the Crop Circle Training Radiation Group, to eradicate all
crop circles, potatoes and the like.  What we would say is with this invasion,
we will find that many different countries will mysteriously have atomic
testing.  We find as one, the biggest entry point in the countries of this
Earth is found first in India, as promised.  And then, what is known as
Pakistan.  People do not believe for one moment that India and Pakistan had
detonated an atomic bomb.  One has their technology to do this, more or less. 
It is an underground attack of these entry items of galactical war.  They had
been eradicated by the atomic fusions of five droppings in India, thereby
traveling and escaping to Pakistan.  In which so, do not be a bit surprised if
Tibet explodes a nuclear bomb.  And then we all will be crazy.  For then this
whole thing has been under attack in its own prime.  The war, you will see,
will continue.  The weather changes have encountered.  We have not been here in
a long time.  We have been encountered as busy.  Many violations of the laws
and entry points have been going on and even though we would love to lie in
support and give information all this time, it just cannot be accomplished.  
Oh, happy faith.  There are many items that are happening before our eyes.  But
we need to be aware of this invasion, that it will affect many countries.  They
will camouflage it a testing when in reality, it is a full confrontation for
the World Order.  We stand before ourself and say,  do I need this?  Do I need
a World Order?  Do I need the priming of this?  But in all reality, this is
what controls these countries.  Yes, we have not been here but we are visitors
and this entry point is that of what we have said.   One attack meets another
attack.  With two of these ships in the Earth, we too must become on a war
alert.  Meaning, the arsenal of equipment will be turned on and utilized by
various different sundry people.  Earth.  We know that the scared moment of the
now is challenged by the unknown problems of the fare and the bold and the
hereafter.  We would like to say we notice the energy field and we notice your
thoughts and dreams.  Of course, each step at this point will mean a struggle,
a valuable lesson in itself.  But each accomplishment must be had in a slow
fashion.  In a concise fashion.  We have seen the troubles of the moon and
stars.  We have gone back from this solar system to the one beyond to the one
beyond that.  They are all lined up in all different directions.  The conflict
goes on.  But the saving grace of this conflict is simply repeating that force
and centering yourself in that energy of blue.  So when that need is come, you
could call upon us to be there and support what has to be accomplished.  We
find ourselves with a certain amount of time.  We will answer as many questions
as we can and speak more to you about as many subjects as we can.  It is not
easy to move back and forth at this moment, but we are doing what we can in the
moment.  Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Do I understand correctly
like in the beginning of the Zohar it talks about the 42 letters which could be
44 adding 2, the creation of one another, these are 42 alien races plus two
that were involved in the creation of what we know as creation when this earth,
this universe. And the 5 were against the creation. 44 were somehow involved
for the creation of man, the five were against it. And this is where it started
the whole chain reaction to that. Sort of correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And then you get the, when
they go to the council, then the council, talking about the council on Mars is
all these alien races together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And the 5 are the ones

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And they are the same as
what they call the 42 judges and the book of the dead who judge man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes. question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You mentioned that the
gods original plan was altered and the souls were attached. What was the
original plan?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That man would be
happy in paradise to know and to love and to serve him. Forever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So man was created just
for the service of those gods?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, there were lots
of fruits of the trees and leaves on the ground and the trees need pruning and
keeping. Someone had to do the work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And when the soul was
entered in or when it was attached so to speak, that has started a whole chain
reaction that has changed everything since that point?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That cast them out of
the garden of happiness.</span></p>

they just not happy about it. Thank you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Thank you!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now, how much or how far
can you, are you allowed or can you or will you, I don't know which part you
are of that, interfere or influence with happening on the earth. Are you
allowed to interfere or is that free will.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We interfere, not. We
affect. Change does happen. We only pronounce when it is done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But yet these are the
things that are, somehow the world government, are they going to get away with
it or is it going to be revealed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We are talking on it.
It starts off with a ripple. Things do have a habit of cascading to greater and
greater. Come and talk and open up the ... come and talk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When the instructions were
given a while back dealing with effects from the aliens, you said to do the 150
psalms. What exactly does that do and how does that change?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Those who do not live
in the house should recite the 150 psalms. It sets up a vibrational field for
that individual.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And the aliens can’t
affect them then? they are protected?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The psalms are coded
networks of the alien message of declaration of universal protection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now for us in the house,
when I have done it, I felt a release of pressure or something...but it is
beneficial to anybody I guess. But what does it do for us if we do 150 psalms?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: On the first Friday’s
of the months, a recital of 150 psalms could be done, starting at the 8 o’clock
reading till the end.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The souls that have a
pattern of abduction, if they latch on to the Psalms, then they could break
that pattern couldn’t they?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The  Psalms are the
breaking of the abduction chips.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Ok and the apostles
understanding, do they have an understanding of the aliens and of ships or they
didn’t?</span></p>

these things that had been done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>But in turn, each and
everyone, at the moment of their own death, they could not but understand. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you. Is the Downs
syndrome that we know of, was that originally an alien mixture?...problem?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This was a particular
question given before, not here, but by some other individual at another place.
The answer is yes. Downs syndrome is a mutant alien child.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Where was that question
asked before?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It was asked to the
entity in your lovely Town restaurant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Oh. That was me. Thank you
very much.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: What? Repeat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I think that was me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It might have been
you, but it was also the owner that mentioned it too. You need to talk to her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In the Cayce readings, it
was mentioned that the retarded children &#8209; and I don't know if that's
exactly the Downs syndrome &#8209; but that retardation is usually that one
part of the soul is in hell or in another &#8209; or something like that, while
another part of that soul is experiencing these different love and goodnesses
of other people because they have to be taken care of.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This concept would be
very difficult to believe. Their soul coud be triregretic or trimectorial.
Trimectorial is a system in which the activity of the soul is duplicated into a
fall of composites of different allegories which would make the explanation
obviously sieve, or better yet separate avenue of chambers. The soul is never
really separated into chambers, but yet compartments are made. Chambers are
then the after&#8209;effect of the compartments. A soul, in its own pure
essence, can have the possibility and capability of networking with other souls
of its kind. There are many people walking the earth that are connected from
soul to soul having one soul yet 2 bodies. And in this connection the formula
is the compartment of chambers. That is why chamber music is the music of the
soul.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So is that then accurate,
in the Cayce reading that...?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well we just showed
that the soul can separate into many different chambers Therefore, such
explanation shows the relativity and also the congeniality of an event in which
a soul can be in one consciousness, but yet established in another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And where does the alien
come in?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Aliens come in
through the walls, at any time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was there a specific race
that started the Downs syndrome?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, we would say
that the &#8209; what would be Grays incorporated the Talls incorporated the
Blondes incorporated the Reptilians and Dog race, each one mixing too much
together. It is a possiblity that these souls, as we have expressed, divided and
separated into chambers, is the same division or terminology in this particular
case as divided and separated into chambers of different species &#8209; the
aliens versus humanoids.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So, any one of these
chambers, one could be a soul split up...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You must understand
that the aliens have put a lot of humans on the earth for their population and
procreation. Man had gone into a different evolution despite the aliens' attack
and attachments, and also implementations. Man was given by the first Adam the
spirit of life and incorporated this spirit of life as the breath of life, in
which makes man a very developed and very distinguished soul in all the
galaxies. Man and woman on the earth have what would be considered the
capabilities of creation, self&#8209;procreation, more than any other animals
in the galaxies. Man and woman are what would be considered a loose cannon.
They're unpredictable. They make no sense. There's nothing that is concrete.
Man and woman from the beginning of time do not belong to anything of other
galaxies or to the spirit of the God, or the spirit of life. This is a
complicated matter. But the aliens are trying to procreate themselves, and a
lot of times it's not successful, which breaches the whole formula and
chromosomes, which causes this type of defect or deficiency. Remember, there is
no need for a defective chromosome. Certain lights and vibrations can make and
alter the defective chromosome into the positive chromosome that it was created
to be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What does a successful
alien baby look like?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We would say the
Chinese race is considered successful interbreed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Any particular alien race
or...?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Reptilian and the Dog
from Ulsa Minor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Dog from Ulsa Minor?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Did they start out Chinese
or people from that place, and then the aliens came in, or they  were like
everybody and...?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They were fair and
had normal eyes like everyone, but of course the interbreeding made them
through the thousands of years look the way they look.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are now the Chinese then
the exclusive...are the Chinese exclusively then the Reptilian alien?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Other aliens have
integrated with the &#8209; what is known as Chinese race, so therefore,
they're not just totally Chinese alien race of Reptilian species.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How about the Japanese?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Japanese are of the
same type of source.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Tartars?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Same.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the whole yellow race.</span></p>

years' work, children, not over night. Thousands of years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Any other alien that has
taken over a whole race?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Indian people are
implemented into this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: American Indian?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Indian
...(someone explains India) and also the Aztecs or Peru. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You must understand
the Aztec and the Peru people &#8209; you cannot understand them unless you
incorporate them being one with the aliens and their civilization. In the
mountains of Peru, the aliens were one and walked and talked and incorporated
their civilizations from Mars there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Any particular alien?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Choose one. Each one
doesn't matter. There were hundreds of people interbred with the aliens who
walked and talked with them, at least 44 of the type area...type situation.
This was the incorporation of it. A lot of the alien people wanted sacrifices
for the children. Children sacrifices &#8209; so that they would give up their
children to the aliens for interbreeding and extension of their races and of
course this certain amount of energy for the aliens when they take the source
into the child of the aliens' breed &#8209; had energy given to them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Did the aliens actually
want those children dead then?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Eventually some
wanted them because they were able to take that essence from them at the moment
of death.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are any of the people...?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: See, the reason why
we are talking to you about these things &#8209; we know how traumatic it might
be for you all, but you might as well know the truth instead of sticking your
head in the sand. But we've talked many, many years about these people, the
aliens all around us &#8209; all around you. Not us, but you. Fortunately,
you’re in paradise of heavenly tours, you know, but... The Reptilian aliens,
which are powerful, are on their way as their cyclical &#8209; they come every
4,000 years. And that's who we're fighting &#8209; not us of course &#8209; we
are watching them fight, and conflicts are happening, and that’s...well,
there's lots of water traveled because these are the... Reptilians are
underground...are called Dracule. What happened?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You said
&quot;Dracula&quot;, right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The C: hannellors: Well, that's
where that guy comes from, because they need the blood from humans, and that's
where they had the children, 'cause they needed to...see the energy...Do you
get the picture, you know? Do you want to sit here talking...get the film
Dracula and watch it...you know...suck the energy, suck the blood, you
know...slurpees...slurpees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And those are the ones
that created the whole Chinese nation?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They're the ones that
helped to create, they're not the only ones, there's others involved, had their
finger in the pie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Paradise, as you know it,
started on Mars. And then it fell apart, and then they all dumped everybody
here on the earth. That's why the buildings and the temples and the pyramids
and the structures are in tact on Mars, 'cause nothing was destroyed. Cities
and empires are still on Mars.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Did Mars have an
atmosphere?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Oh yes, it still
does.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, we'll tell you
quietly. You can live on Mars, and you can breathe on the moon. You don't need
this big equipment &#8209; you can walk on the moon and breathe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: With all these.-how to ask
it. From all the people,from the original &#8209; from the first crop of people
on the earth, as we understand it, and the time of chaos in Genesis &#8209; the
people that turned themselves, that went into things, and created themselves
into creatures and suForces: are those the people that the aliens can easier
possess?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No, no, no. Those are
the aliens interbreeding with those people, creating monstrosities and
conflicts and all sorts of different things, I mean there's a field day at that
point.</span></p>

before the Garden of...that was at the time of chaos, at the first creation?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Anything that took
place here on the earth happened after Paradise. Paradise failed; man and woman
revolted. Remember, in the Garden of Eden, it was Dracule that came to Eve.</span></p>

to Eve?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It was the Retilian
alien with the wingspan on its back of its neck. Fourteen feet long to the
left, 22 feet long to the right, and bring the spans together and you turn out
right. You know the horns coming out of Dracule were the horns of the Reptilian
force. Antennas, right? Who seduced Eve?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The snake, the dragon, the
dracule...</span></p>

after...</span></p>

absolutely don't like those movies. Did I have a personal experience?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, you do not
particularly like to see these Reptilian forces, 'cause they strike terror in
you and because they remind you of another experience of lifetime in combatting

C'mon, sparkle up people, what did she do?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Oh, after she had Cain?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No, no, no, no. After
she had Dracule.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Oh, after she had Dracule
she went to Adam, and ..</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: And said
&quot;More!&quot; So, Adam and Eve started procreating &#8209; fiercely.
Bumpies under the ground, bumpies in the leaves, bumpies everywhere. Kept them
busy, right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Yeah. When they walked in
the Garden of Eden with God, before Satan, who was that God? Was that...who was
that God?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Who was that masked
man?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Who was that force of God,
or who was God? Was that you?</span></p>

know the dude.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But God is...there is a
God that is way and above and beyond any aliens. Or is aliens that we call God?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well this is a . The
reason why is we don't want to break your bubble about your God. But if we were
to tell you everything that we know about this creation of yours, you would go
and get a MacDonald's hamburger and a milkshake, and enjoy that to your
fullest. What we're trying to say is through evolution of time gods, aliens
walk the earth. Our main job, as we promised you from the very beginning of
talking with you, was to bring you through this troubled time. And God knows
it's going to be troubled. So, as time goes on we will try to give you as much
information as we possibly can. If we gave you this information totally in
1970, you would go bonkers, am I right? Yes of course. You would not be able to
understand. It took you 20 years for you to comprehend us. It's gonna take us a
thousand years for us to comprehend you. You gotta understand: you guys are so
dangerous, that the whole galaxy out there are frightened to come to earth,
because you are seducers. You have emotions. You have the prettiest eyes
that...the point is: you don't know who you are. Now the entity knows who you
are, that's why he has a lot to deal with. He knows you're...active, living.
But there's a job to do and there's work to do in the next few years. There has
to be things that have to be accomplished. Now, can you imagine what we're
trying to tell you? You have your mind, you have your perception, you have your
concepts. You're a threat to the alien population because you are the
strongest. And you are the strongest &#8209; does any of you know why you are
the strongest?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Because we have the
complete soul.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Okay. But why are you
the strongest? Elementary. Elementary, why are you the strongest? Because I
tell you so? I could say you're real pretty and then you'd have the biggest ego
going here tonight. Why are you strongest?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Because we have the
emotions?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes. You do have
emotions that the aliens do not have. You send them for a loop with your
emotions up and down, up and down, up and down. Why are you the strongest, what
do you do that they can't do?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Create, procreate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Okay, but what else
do you do, not only procreation, but what else to you do that they can't do?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Several voices: Pray.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Pray. What was the
other?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Free will.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Free will. And the
other?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Meditation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Those 3 elements:
procreation, pray, meditation, free will. You have blood of (NAME) inside you,
the name we gave you from the beginning. (NAME) is the son of the Empire that
you come from. And from this Empire &#8209; which is the greatest in the
galaxies, and the strongest, the most powerful &#8209; you, as slaves, as
humans, as ..as cattle, are not supposed to know that you have ownership to
this empire. It is through the blood of (NAME) that is handed down through
Adam, is handed down to Oviah. Oviah then is known as Ovlah&#8209;ee&#8209;lot.
In the &quot;Lot&quot; experience, that became the pivoting point in which the
aliens said: &quot;Man, woman are stronger than us. We must end that experience
that you do not remember this.&quot; That is why Lot's wife was turned to salt.
She looked back and remembered the experience. &quot;It must not be
remembered,&quot; they said. Now, we will talk to you, for the time is short.
The entity is being formed and changed, and there are times when we will come
through him, and you will say: &quot;This is strange, for this is not
him.&quot; But we do not have time to go and give sessions like this that we
will come through and give it to you directly. But, when Sodom and Gomorrah was
burned to a cinder, the flames and a...(pause). What happened in Sodom and
Gomorrah is nuclear fission, that every cell that had energy of life exploded,
combustible fusion. And it was imploding for three and half years. In that
three and a half span years, anyone who looked to this city would be imploded,
a flame of implode, explosion of flames turning them after it was over to salt.
This was done by the Empire, that you had come from and you have ownership to,
and the right of ownership. Because the son came from the empire, saw you in
the Garden of Eden as slaves, and illuminated you with his spirit. Not that you
procreate, that makes you great. Not that you have free will that makes you
great, even though these aspects are a pain in the royal butt. But, what makes you
great &#8209; AND MOST POWERFUL &#8209; HEAR THESE WORDS. Meditation, chanting,
and prayer makes you the greatest entity in the galaxies. For that you bring
down the energy of the earth into your selves, then you start and you bring it
up into the galaxies. This is an element the aliens <u>cannot </u>handle. They
cannot understand. They are transfoxiated. or in reality, <u>formlessness.</u></span></p>

<h5>Session ??</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Can you give the date of
the time of Abraham?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Abraham. What  is
this with this group? But we understand your clusters for thoughts and forms.
Abraham. Get me the Book of Abraham. As it has been seen, Abraham came from the
seed of Noah. Noah was the only one who prescribed into the Laws of God. Noah
went astray and therefore everyone followed as the flood or deluge came, followed
upon that seed in which Noah was. That he interjected that doubt, that he
interjected that lust and desire. Abraham represents the only seed from Noah
that remained faithful to God. Abraham took Sarah and the son of Lot into that
area of in-development, or that representing within him of his consciousness.
Therefore, if you read that chapter of Genesis, twelve, fifth verse, you will
understand what we say of the progression in which Abraham did leave.  Also you
have that Tower of  Babelor, Babel in which people were afraid of the flood to
happen once more. Therefore they build the structure high so that they will not
see this happen to them again, going against the Laws of God. How many times do
you think that you are going to out smart God and do things to prevent the
crime or the things to happen to you.  Do not build your own Towers of Babylon,
for they will fall and scatter you amongst the people. The area or that time
for the moment in which was right, just before the great flood, the great flood
lasting at 10,000 bc, at the end near to it. Abraham roughly will come around
the age, as what you would have it known to be, 925 bc, lasting over a hundred
years to 825 or 827 or 824 or 820. Abraham representing into you that of his
doubts in which God or that Higher Diety spoke to him and said he shall bear a
son. Coming in soul with all his years and his progressions with his wife
Sarah, his progressions with her and their progressions with him, physically,
mentally, and spiritually. In their progression they had to develop so that the
son of Isaac or Isaaic could come into the line or lineage. Hagar is the name
of the slave.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Session 157</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Well Abram when he came
with his brother and they divided the land, he came from Ur.  Is that another
name for Atlantis?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Ur is a province of
what would be known as Babylon. Or near that said section. But also it is the
terminology of the Crites that came from the continent of Crite. C_R_I_T_E.
Crite. As one might say, Crite already. It was a province of sector,. didn’t
know it would strike such a harmonious-sphere of laughter. It is a province of
the third section of fourth sections in what was Atlantis, residing on the
northeast section. Being convenient when the eruptions did take place, that
their flight led into what was known as Babylon. Or became to know as Babylon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So actually they were the
Sons of the Law of One?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They were the Sons of
God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They abided by the
Laws even though they transgressed against them. They still consciously knew in
their hearts the Laws and where they perceived them from and where it came
from, for they were newly entered souls into the earth and forgot not their
God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Where do the Sumerians
come in?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Sumerians or
Sumerites or Sumerians are called the after effect or by-product of the long
linage of Babylon. It is a mind interpretation in which history plays games.
But it is from Crite that they came to Babylon and from their they mixed into
many other areas, causing the second tribe or what would be a second line
called Sumerian. Is this interesting?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They are all one
line. Also may we reveal one thing to you?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We snuck in and gave
them more than they had.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: More in What?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: More-in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: People  <br>
Forces: Thank you. This will be very hard for some to understand. So at this
moment we will not explain what we have just said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And Abram was one of these
snuck in people?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Repeat please.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Abram, Abraham, known as
Abraham, was was then one of those people that came in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You are now using
your head.  Moses was the one that we gave in. Lord knows how many we gave in
before that. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>[…]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are you then the Empire?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: If we were the
Empire, then you are empty. Empire did not talk to the ones that were being
threatened. You were the threaten-ers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are we not belonging to
the name...don't we have a part in the name, and is it not from the Empire?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Of (NAME)?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: (NAME) was the son of
the royal family of the empire. So of course you have a part of the empire. We
are the Higher Forces that you have named us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We are not part of
the Empire. Guess again. We know the dude.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was he from the Dogs?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You once...talked about
something about the principalities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Why do you think
Moses was not allowed to see God?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I thought because he
transgressed by striking the stone twice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No, no, no, no. Why
was Moses not allowed to see the face of God on Mount Sinai?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Because he'll be burned
down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: He would have seen an alien.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Same reason we...that he
was...same reason as we feel about the aliens. We're a threat to them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: What would you do if
you saw us in our total nature?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I once asked that question
whether we would be terrified of you, and you said: &quot;It is possible.&quot;
But I don't know what that answer means.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Then we shall reveal
ourselves to you and you will see. (Long pause) What we are saying is: now,
look within. The feel that you felt is the revelation of the same. To manifest
what we are, we...but, for Moses to see what they were would frighten him,
disgust him. Therefore, God had to hide himself from Moses, for fear that Moses
would be freaked. We know the dude. What we are saying, in the history of the
Jewish people they saw a cross&#8209;section of aliens called gods. They were
inter-breeded with the spirits of God, but there was a battle to control the
Jewish nation of Israel, and each alien tried their best for control. Then came
God. Now, there's so much to talk about. Poor Moses, just meshed with many
different batches of aliens and God. He could not understand one from the
other, cause they all had different things going on. One fed the people, one
followed the people, one gave water, one gave the floods. The Reptilians were
the one that did the curse on Egypt. The blood that came from the earth was the
war the of the Reptilians and the aliens with one another that created the
bloodshed of the Reptilians underground, which exploded them, creating their
blood to come into the water. I hope this doesn't complicate your lives.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The Reptilians with who?
With who did they fight that the blood...?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Reptilians sent the
curse of the plagues on Egypt, for they were fighting the gods of the north, or
the Talls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I keep getting the message
majority that the Reptilians are the bad guys, but then from time to time I
keep receiving that they did some stuff that was good, or that was in the...l
don't understand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They were not bad,
but for the sake of not judging, it's best to say they were the instrument that
got you out of the Garden of Eden.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: That's pretty bad.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Not unless you were
knowing that the Garden of Eden from the Gods kept you as slaves there. Listen,
if you had to pick fruit all day long, you would get tired of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Were the Reptilians as is
depicted a fallen angel or a messenger of God?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They were not that
bad, but they became bad because they gave you the knowledge that you could
procreate any time you wanted to. They were subjected by the gods to tum you on
and off when they wanted you to. <u>He </u>came along and told you you could do
it anytime. Which made you very what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Independent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: As George Burns would
say, very prolific. But, (NAME) came and gave you the breath of life, the
spirit of the Gods that transferred and transcended you into another plateau.
Not just for procreation alone, even though if God gave you a bunker, as they
call it, but you go even higher. Do you know where the alien bunkers are at?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In the pole. In the ice
poles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, of course they
are because they don't use their bunker anymore.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Jesus and the
Name...what's the relationship between the two?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They are the same.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: That's what I thought. So
Jesus was the manifestation of that force coming in?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct. Because he
had a job to do, he had to continue it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So he wasn't Adam?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Oh yeah, he was Adam
too. We forgot to tell you that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So when (NAME
mispronounced by one letter) took over, or took care of us, we're considered
his children, is the word (NAME) symbolic to the father of the untamed? For
some reason I'm seeing that the word (NAME) can be reversed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: (NAME) was the son
that came from the empire, and no transversion can be made. The sound must
(NAME) be the same. It cannot be transverse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is it not better not to
say that unless we need to?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is said here for
you to here it. It has been told not to mention it in public, or openly, unless
you need the force to manifest before you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: If he was the Empire,
what...was that an alien race too? Because we've studied other material and it
was not that race.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You're alien. They're
alien. Everyone's alien.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So how does this relate to
what they call the Dak?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The duck?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: and others: The Dak.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It would be nice to
have a duck in here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was the name above all
that, part of the council then?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Drech? Is that what
you're saying?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: No, was the name that you
gave us, was it part of the council at that point, or was it...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The name we gave you
came from the Empire, the highest Empire, yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So what race was the
Empire?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Reptilian.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So they were the good
Reptilians?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Wait a second. This is
where I was getting the messages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Yeah, yeah, the good ones.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Wait a second. Is there
good Reptilians and bad Reptilians, or is it just Reptilians?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Their Reptilians are
fair in stature, and refined, and they're good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And this is the highest
Empire?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Wait a second.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Doesn't that beat
all?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Yep!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Wait a second.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: That's why the Forces had
that Reptilian flying serpent on their uniforms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Caduces?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: That's why Moses' staff
became a reptile and ate the other reptiles. All the magicians made the
reptiles, out of sticks, but Moses' ate up the others. But is there...are there
two kinds of reptilian? Is there a fallen son, as there is...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let's make it a wait
a minute. I”ll tell you everything we can tell you. For it's imminent that we
openly have dialog. Time is short. You need to know as much as you can know.
But, if you had an Empire, and someone came to your workers and revealed that
they can procreate, that energy becomes very prolific and very rebellious. The
Empire then gets mad at the one who Reveals it to the workers. So that is why
that particular Reptilian dracule is fallen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the fallen one is the
one that revealed? He is the bad guy to the Empire?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So when it comes down to
us he's the bad guy too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are you saying, then, that
Dracula is a friend to humanity?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, we wouldn't go
that far. Remember, there are many different alternates and sides of the story.
If that was not true, we would not say it. But as I show you this side of the
prism, know ye that there is another side. Is that not just dandy?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The relationship of the
Empire to the gods...cause when you referred to gods two sessions ago, and I
asked you gave several names of God. What is the relation of the Empire to
those three names that you gave us?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The highest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The Empire's the closest
to the gods?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No. Let us try to
give you an explanation. That Empire was challenged by Ulsa Minor and Ulsa
Major. That is your other Empires. These are the ones that eat humans &#8209;
you. These have an appetite, you are their delicacies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are they the Dogs?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That is the Dog
empire. That was the one that went to the Reptilian empire. The Reptilian
empire is the most sophisticated, most powerful empire in the galaxies.  But we
told you that, right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Now, remember we know
the dude. Keep in mind, as we show you and have this dialog in present terms,
your question &quot;Is there a god higher than that Empire&quot; &#8209; you.
You. You are the god. You are the gods. You. You don't understand that, do you?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is it that aspect, divine
aspect inside that we're talking about, that we...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: C'mon now. </span><span

the gods. C'mon. You have the power. How do you have the power? You're like
little...You are little...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is it like it like in the
book Arcturus?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Excuse us, we're
having a nervous breakdown.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The Name you gave us,
where did he get the...where did he get...he was the Name that was of the
empire...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You are the
condensers. And you are the formless ones. We have just given you the secrets
of yourselves that they don't want you to know.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So if we knew how to
use...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: We can control matter,
that's what you're saying. Because we are able to control matter, we condense
it, or we are formless. That means we can create ourselves, create the
universe...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: More than that. It's
create.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Up until Atlantis we could
create forms and bodies to go into, but when Atlantis and when the flood
came...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: ...the flood. Why the
flood? What did I give you as an explanation every single time you see flood?
What does it relate to?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Everyone: Reptilians.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Channellor: Reptilians.
Or with the Reptilians' flood, what happened?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: A force came in from
outside, hit the earth, and caused it to flood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: What happened with
Atlantis you were able to create formless ones. You were able to create the
Atlantean experience. The flood happened, what happened with the flood?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: It destroyed that, it
wiped out...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It wiped&#8209;no! It
doesn't destroy anything. It wiped out your what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Formless ones. What we
created.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It wiped out your
remembrance of the formless ones, your consciousness that you should not
remember it. Any great cataclysmic event is an event that happens to help erase
your remembrance of it.</span></p>

still exists, but we don't remember it. Or is ability also put under some type
of control?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the ability's also
under control, so it really can't be exercised at the moment?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Wait. We did not take
this time out just to reach this point to give you misinformation. Repeat what
you just said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The ability has also been
put under a control, or not allowed at this time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You think it has been
put under control or not allowed at this time? That is not the reality. That is
what they want you to believe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So we could still do those
things?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Do you believe you
can?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Mmhmm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Then you can.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So it's no different than
what we're living is the exactly like total recall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So we can change
molecules, change...create things out of nothing?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You can receive and
get answers by the very work. Some can get less than others. Some are increased
more and heightened more. But then when you start receiving, it becomes what we
want to give you. My/our main objective is to get your filament to such a point
that we can start pushing into your thoughts, into your concepts, creative
revelational forms of thinking that could actually blow everyone's mind away
that it comes from you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Can we still power cities
by thought?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But we can only do that
through excessive amounts of our prayers and meditations, that's why the entity
always says we need to make our personal meditations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Heighten that, and that
will be the only way for us to bring in all that stuff that's coming.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It's not only the
only way. It's what tums you on. But see...that's the answer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is there a higher god,
though?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We know the dude.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is there...yeah...but,
you're saying that we are gods and that is what the Bible says too. That's what
Jesus said also. You are now giving detailed information of what is meant by
it. But is there also a higher god?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We know the dude. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And did he create us?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is that a God that
is...original?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Now let's not get
into this god up here. You know we always have this power structure. We want
the ultimate power. We want the ultimate dude, you know? We want this god up
here. That we will eventually reveal to you...where everything fits. But right
now we're just dealing with basic terminology to get you to understand these
concepts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now the power...the power
that you speak of &#8209; is it through prayer and meditation we're able to
call on something that has the power. For example, sometimes you hear of a
profit that called and then something else came down and did it, or is it
actually that we can exercise the power if we know how to do it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Remember, by these
prayers and meditations and chanting you then are revealed into the power, the
power becomes revealed to you. Remembrance of the nameless one becomes
manifest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Remembrance of the
nameless one?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: If there is anything
else we have accomplished tonight, it is to give you some structure of what and
where we are going. It is to give you some thought of what the people who lived
on this earth went through. It will give you some semblance of order. To
understand that there are many different things that are being manifested
through you. And it also is to reveal the intricate network of this lovely
vocational planet you call earth. It is the gem of the universe. It is the
tourist spot of tours. It is the heightened pace of paradise that everybody
wants to come to for a vacation. You know what? You are stuck here. At this
point, we are trying to illuminate you how to move through this and not be just
here. There's much...Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You don't mean that this
is really a heav...l mean a beautiful spot, the earth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This was made to be a
vacation home for the aliens to get away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But something happened,
because Jesus called it a heap of garbage. A garbage heap.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, considering all
the stuff that's going on here, he's technically correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We're not just saying
this just to get more work from you. Then we would put you back in the Garden
of Eden. But.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The gods, the Empire, and
the Higher Forces &#8209; how do they all relate?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We do very nicely,
thank you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: At one point you said &#8209;
in one of the sessions in […], I think &#8209; you manifested yourself at one
time to the people on the earth as dragons..in the beginning. And then at
another point you said that either you are the principalities, or something
like that, I think that's what was said, if I understood.  At this point, could
you tell us who you are?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Remember, we are
constantly revealing ourselves to you. The more you know, the more you know of
us. To tell you in words: we are the jelly beans. Would that mean anything to
you? We are the dragons. What does that mean to you? We are the principalities.
What does that mean to you? We are the dragons. We are the principalities. But
we're much more than that. You've got to be impressed with that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Yes. Why is the time
coming...running...Why is the time short? And what is it, the things…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Because the time's
not long.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What is the time short
for?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Open up the Bible to

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Okay. Alright, but
now go on. Anyone else? If you were Chinese, what would these organs mean to
you?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Energy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is the soul in

liver.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is it the adrenal glands?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes. Now, read the
verse again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Okay. What you have
here is each is above the organ. Above each organ the manifestation of the soul
of the body, addressed as the adrenal glands, addressed as the caul. This is
what they are trying to take &#8209; the aliens from man, from the entity of
man &#8209; their souls. Because they have lost their energy level, this is
what they're interested from you. But in the same breath, your prayers and
meditation protects these organs. We know you find this particular session
enthusiastically warm, receptive and also educational. And above all very
enlightening and illuminating. But there is a lot more to speak about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the time is short
because the aliens &#8209; some of the aliens &#8209; I have now a whole
transformation in my head because I thought that the Reptilians were bad, and
now I don't know for sure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They're there. But
then you have something over here behind this curtain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the thing...the only
thing we can do is pray and meditate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: If, if the aliens are
coming into the Earth, why are they fighting over the Earth?  What is, what’s
so special about the Earth - the universe and zillions of planets and galaxies
– what’s so special about this one?  Why does everybody want to tamper with
this one?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: In fact, why don’t
they leave you alone?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Exactly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We understand the
concept.  But remember, the Earth is filled up with souls that the
extraterrestrials don’t understand.  And you have emotions they don’t have. 
And you have the ability to sing, and praise the spiritual side in you, and the
ability to be creative.  They want that.  That is why they have put on the
Earth many viruses so they can get that energy away from the Earth.  They
cannot handle the Earth with all this nonsense going on.  Therefore, their
quest to subdue the Earth and shut up all the creative people of the Earth
because its too much noise.  What we’re trying to say is they cannot handle the
emotions.  It’s foreign to them.  They live off the emotions.  They cannot
handle it.  What we’re trying to say, is you also have been given the key of
remembrance and the key of the Kingdom.  They want that.  It’s not your
emotions they’re after, even though that is interesting to them.  They want
your inheritance, the right to the Kingdom.  They do not want you, as Earth
people, to remember that key to the Kingdom.  They want it.  Therefore, the
biggest fight goes on on the Earth to get control over the Earth and its people. 
You are a prize possession.  You are a prize commodity.  You are a prize item
that’s not found anywhere in the galaxies.  Because of your love and your
heart, they do not understand it and cannot comprehend.  That is what’s alien
to them and they need to control it so they can control this Kingdom that is
huge among us, great, enormous, on and on and on.  You just happen to be in
their way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is there any connection
between what you just said and Jacob and Esau story?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There is a
connection.  There is a very good connection.  We are just trying to tell you
that you’re not in the way.   You have just as much right to be here in this
galaxy as anyone else and a right to your own position and space and place.  We
hope that helped you with your question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Can I ask another
questions?  Does this mean that the Earth, per say, in all the entire universe,
is unique to this, to this one configuration?  It doesn’t exist anywhere else?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So what does exist
everywhere else?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: As a matter of fact, they
just discovered another planet.  What. (end of tape.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Picks up in the middle of
answer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: …but I doubt it to be
anywhere in a replica of what’s on the Earth.  Forget it.  The only thing that
comes close to Earth is that of your sisters planets of Mars and Venus and
that’s because they’re intertwineable.  Mars has been colonized and inhabited
until it was no longer feasible to be there and they all jumped on to the
Earth.  In the evolutionary scale, it’s moving up and to the point where Mars
has already been, but what we’re trying to say (tape goes blank)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: (tape picks up)… then if
we’re unique here, is it, how do the other worlds exist?  I mean, it’s, it’s,
the different, there must be zillions of different kinds of aliens but their
not, how do they fit in the scheme of things?  I mean, if we’re, if we’re part
of God, then what are they?  How do they exist?  I mean, what’s their
evolution?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They exist perfectly
naturally and happy.  But their difference according to their specie gene
coupling, according to their maker, their existence is just as important as
yours.  But it is different and so being different, it’s different because of
the area they come from or galaxy they come from just as on your planet Earth,
those living in tropical countries have different skin tones than those who are
living in colder areas of your country.  They all have different works,
different jobs, different skills and this is something , ah, you will, as you
will go on to find out exist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So, is their God and our
God is not the same?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We can say that the
God concept can be a shock but it is a overall omnipotent God that is
overseeing all of this, that goes beyond this galaxy and beyond all the other
galaxies that you can even imagine.  There, in the distant place, is what you
call God and that terminology and concept can apply there.  But you’re here, so
therefore, that cannot be understood at this moment because you’re too busy
dealing with the things you need to deal with here.  Therefore, not to say
their God’s different.  There are many directors before you get to the
Godhead.  So, in this particular question, yes, their God is different.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So their local God is
different just like our local God, Delerheim (?) etc.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Do they have, ah, visibly
physical bodies or anything similar to ours.  Is it, is it different dimensions
or is it the same?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Everything will be
different according to the area and dimension they live in.  They’re some who
can live and exist and come into the Earth and have their beings and move on
and you will not even know it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Because they come from
different dimensions?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And, are there, as

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Greetings to all here
present. Now we are in this area, and have seen many changes that are coming
about in the political field and endeavors of international and national
control. We find that conflicts are still carrying itself on in this mood and
great conflicts and battles are ensuing through the Isles of Jupiter.  We also
find that the Soviet Unions tables are filled with the selling and bartering of
our own life, of remember that these extra aliens visiting and coming in this
area are not friendly and we see tremendous conflict internally and above the
earth, because the silvers (abhor such conflict) such so that you would have to
take the conflict going, sealing itself off from ...kind of helps you grow into
a strong but aloft, all in all we find that these changes are coming closer and
closer. As far as where would you like of course with these changes you do have
the secret police on your side. We are trying to get people to understand the
many changes and adapts in the world history, it is something like a rebirth
and in so doing .... seems like that in this session, you might have three to
four individuals speaking, if that happens, pay no attention to the other
three, the one that is speaking is the one you need to listen to. We know that
in your society, knowing the many different changes and strange encounters that
you meet with, we have a feeling that you are MacDonald Hamburgers, wonder what
this means? Well the great arch is the symbol of the reptilian aliens, three
arches is of a different race, but the double Mac burger, unfortunately, is an
alien symbol and is the reptilian symbol from IO the planet celeste galaxy IO.
In this we, we did not want to tell you everything that is happening, but we
have just got confirmed and over our own TV screens, says more or less to say,
the answer was &quot;what the heck&quot;. So it was that we tried to speak to
you to that point in which we got confirmed to speak to you. MacDonald as you
have the fast burger, is a reptilian controlled organisation world order style.
It is something .... it represents meat hamburger and your hamburger meat. It
is controlled by and to infiltrate every government and country it can possibly
get into and unfortunately, bear with us, there are microchips in the plastic,
they are sending out waves and information and gathering of information and
used as a front. We did not particularly want to tell you all this, because
there is enough paranoia&#8209;ism going on at this very moment, but of course,
MacDonald is used as an alien force phase front, by the world order and
governments of both sides. So it is a convenient spot, there is nothing wrong
with it, but you need to understand where it is coming from. It will be
controlled and it will be usefuL not only for the reptilian aliens, but also
for us, we will take advantage of it. Of course you will say, well ,what does
this mean to us, hmm everything and nothing, everything because there are many
different changes coming, and in this part of the things that are coming, we
find that the labels and symbolisms are more pronounced than ever before. There
is the question of how do you know the alien reptilian force or alien reptilian
in front of you? There are many different caricatures of a reptilian person,
this is what I would consider the breakdown of reptilian knowledge or you
knowing the fact that the reptilian society alien creatures as we spoke about
many years ago, are on their way back. Needless to say, what does this impact
apply upon us, being that we are here and the representation of this force, you
are protected in that very presence of our presence of this particular mode of
creature, therefore, they cannot touch you. It is not you we worry about, but the
force of others that are into our line and breaking out and sharing of this
protection is our main goal. We still have not answered the question, we know.
How can you discern a reptilian alien in front of you? You can't, why can't
you? you can't. Well that phone call is good but we must not break this
connection. How can you tell, they have slits in their eyes lateral or known as
cats eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1. obstacle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2. Scales. There are œrtain
scale&#8209;like creatures that being of reptilian nature, their scales would
be found below the ear lobes or in back of the ears, they are scale nature
substances.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>3. You would find more or
less a foul smell, occasionally coming from them, they cannot process the food
or air vitally right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>4. They do try to interfere
and block information, they do not particularly like this information coming
through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>5. They are mathematical,
very’ very astute to mathematics and very wise in calculus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>6. They find themselves to be
always finger digital movement mild force, in short they have a problem of
fingers always moving, reptilian fingers always move they do not stay still.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>7. Serpent tongue. The tongue
is quick and strange as it is there are some reptilian humanoids that have
snake lizard shaped tongues that dart out., that you don't particularly want to
hear, we knew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>8. Then you have scales on
the fingers and the third digit finger has a scale within a scale, moon within
a moon, this is very difficult for them to cover up, they can become humanoid
in certain form, but the third finger has three or two moons on it, this is a
quick give away, no one is supposed to know this, you do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Are they dangerous, they can
be very mean and nasty, have no respect for your children or younger creatures,
in fact they particularly like storing of younger creatures for their food
supply. What does this mean, they abduct children? You have a thousand children
to one thousand five hundred children in America, a day abducted, what does
that mean, they disappear. What did they disappear for, their food, they like the
children because there is no toxins in their bodies, therefore the toxicity of
humans, you, stink, they don't want you, there is too much toxicity’s, more
metals, albumen, all sorts of ....your ecological damage, you are a disaster to
their systems. They are meat eaters and unfortunately, this is the story. Now,
these reptilians are nasty creatures, apart, they look upon the human race with
disparaging ways, they have no regards for you as humans, in fact they have
contempt for humans. They do not like humans, they do not like humans, we could
all say together THEY DO NOT LIKE HUMANS. Well new that the first lesson
continues, now we have fulfilled this information, reptilians are not your
friends. In this way (we don't have to repeat that) we find that reptilian
aliens are not good God&#8209;like creatures, in fact on a scale of one to ten,
of one not being too bad and ten being the worst, they rate a sole total of
thirteen, so, what we would say, these creatures are obnoxious, devious, man&#8209;eaters
and like children, they also have a certain habit of fouling the air, when they
are in or nearby and they have a certain aspect of total dislike for things
other than themselves. What we are all trying to show you here, being
&quot;What the heck&quot; was the command it is to share with you this
information, not to alarm you, but it has been said that the reptilians are
coming back.  Reptilians are also a part of the Satan- Lucifer family, where
they have wings and bat wings in the back scales and have all the
characteristics we have just spoken about, that is why the church had taken it
upon itself, the last time they were here, around the 14th century, 15th
century and 13th century, that they prepared the people and strengthened them
for these evil ones, what they did then, there was no control over, though what
you could not see this, they could do anything they wanted to then and you know
it is almost different now, but they think it is the same, that they could do
anything they want to, well &#8209; not with us being present here and the
force of our presence in this making. Unfortunately, they cannot do everything
they want to then, which is fortunate for yourselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When the reptilians arrive
in two to three months, are there any specific occurrence we might lock for?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: First of all, as we
said, let us focus not on just one race, but a whole lot of races, people have
a feeling that they will be good, when they find out that they are not good,
then they are bad, and if they are bad their not good. Of course you will not
interfere with that particular interaction, but I think we answered the
question whether they are good. We cannot answer any more that they are good or
not, they are just plain downright bad.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The UFO that ------and I
saw, and we didn’t see it in its entirety, was it good or was it evil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: What color was
surrounding it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Orange.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Then we would say
that it was a reptilian force. The orange color is another scale of
information, you see ships in the sky, if they have an orange...glowing force
around it, then you know 99.9% that you will be their Big Mac.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When the reptilians come,
is part of their aim to release this entity off the island and part of the
world order is to control that entity for our purposes or their purposes
against the reptilians?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well that can be
applied, but it is also their ability to infiltrate, take over the earth in a
negative form, which of course, we will not allow to happen, because we
represent that force of Mighty Mouse. We give a secret in that little explanation,
but their force is that they have been here many thousands of years ago and are
just coming back to see what has been done, how the people have advanced and
what has been accomplished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Why did they leave, or
what made them leave in the first place?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Because they are on a
cyclical journey and their comet and force of energy has to be moved wherever
they are at, has to be reflective of the energy field that is allowing them to
be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Oh my God &#8209; am I
understanding?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We understand, that
you understand, that we all might understand. &#8209; Question?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: If it was thousands of
years ago, why did they put, I guess the cathedrals, those are images of
reptiles, why did they put them on top of the cathedrals?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: To remind you of
their presence and  their being here, to remind you of the battle that they had
with them and to remind you that they are still lurking and will be back, also
it is also the aspect of creating the Omar, it is called the thought form, Omar
for them, is that  will not allow them to materialize where such forms are
created.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the cathedral was a
representation of keeping the evil away?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The reason why this
is placed on the high pentacles of the cathedral towers, is because the
reptilians etheric level, forms on that level or that height above the earth,
and it is an Omar to cast them from that level, therefore, they cannot
materialize down on the earth, because the Omar has sent them away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Do they eat flesh or do
they eat the blood?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, I don't knew if
they have a choice of their choosing, the fact is that anything goes with that
aspect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So those that we consider,
or call vampires, are yet another race?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No they are reptilian
by nature too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So they are part of that
race.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They are part of what
would be called the (Dracul) area, more so called Dog People, Dog Face 
(Slupals)  (Woof, Woof)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now, Ann Rice, has she
seen them or is she getting automatic writing?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: She is receiving,
seeing and automatic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So she knows what she is
doing?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: What is the big force
of this, the Dracul dog, dog woof, woof face, has a what would be called a
Uffno that is a repugnancy to us, we have a habit of pissing people off, excuse
us for using that terminology, but we heard, rather to do that than to be......
 but the fact is we angered and aggravated their situation, we do not do it
deliberately, it is our very presence of body and mind. The entity has
activated certain elements within the creative mechanism that he is working
with. To set certain Towers of Strength in the vicinity and areas, and these
Towers and Strengths would be augmented as Pillars of Omar, or Pillars of Omar
to dispel, distract and send away the reptilians, The reptilians work on many
different levels, they can walk through walls, they work also through your
electrical outlets, they also work through, strangely as it is, the running
water of engines, they also do not like Christmas lights. It irritates their
slanted eyes, their astral eyes and Christmas lights are a, what would be
considered, a secret weapon of us. You wondered why we said, many years ago,
hang your lights, hang your Christmas Lights, deck the halls with boughs of
holly. If you are to understand au the weird things you do, you might say, oh,
now we know, so Christmas time is not a particularly good time for the
reptilian races sometimes it is good to hang Christmas lights throughout your
trees all year round, but of course, your electrical bill would send you to the
sky roof, but maybe what we are trying to say is, we fight the alien reptilian
force......Dracul, dog people, woof, woof, in direct or indirect ways and a
direct way openly revealed to you just now is to do that. Another way to fight
the entities or satanic forces is blue colored and light colored colors,
clothing colors can particularly have a...... Question?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The space center in San
Antonio, is that still a strong alien center?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Why did they remove the
dam that used to be there? I mean, was that part of some..?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, let us say the
base is under that, so there was a conflict and skirmish in that regard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Why that particular area,
why is that so good for them?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Because the caverns
and the canals, and the covert action underneath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And is that mostly reptilian?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is it important for us to
always maintain our rings on and our star and crosses when we go outside, being
with all the alien invasions and so on?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The ring was a symbol
to fight the reptilian creature, they cannot take the latticework of the gold
because of its geometric design, it again, is offensive to their optic Light
Lines, eyes, and its symbolic geometric design of the star and cross is an
offensive symbol for them, because we are offensive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I work for a large computer
company research center, with very high&#8209;level intellectual people and
before, you said that one of the characteristics of the reptilians was
mathematics, I worked in a building with very high level mathematicians, is
there a good chance there is a lot of them or a good portion of them in my
building, and if so, how can I protect myself from them?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: I notice a little
nervousness in your voice? &#8209; A blue stone would be good around ,or taped
strange as it is, in the navel area, this blue stone would fight their negative
charge. Reptilians have a habit of taking the energy from this area of its
creatures. Also, yes it is true, you do have a certain percentage of Zill­-yent
people &#8209; we call them Zill&#8209;yent people, these are the crossovers,
that come onto the earth and work as humans, but they are Zill&#8209;yent
people because they are the fore&#8209;runners, or scouts for the main alien
group that is coming in. You also will have the Digital people and these are
the ones we  speak about that are always moving their fingers. I guess it would
stand to reason, in a mathematical operation, that they would be hitting the
calculator more often than not. We also do say that they are very quick with
their formulation of these words and.....(appropriation ,?), to One moment please.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Information &#8209;
IBM is one of the headquarters for the reptilian order.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Information &#8209;
You will have the computer sect orders in California.</span></p>

Apple has an alien base E-quasar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Information &#8209;
You will also have what we call Netcom, Sitcom information order center for the
world order, you would also have what would be called Database and what you
call Internet, this too is a world order control and is sent through, so it
will control the beings and what would be called the chips within people
throughout the world. Just because you work in IBM does not make you a
reptilian.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And that is another
question &#8209; can they, in the classic stories of the vampires, they can
turn humans and make them into vampires, is that something that is real, or is
that something, what is it exactly, do they create zombies so that they can
feed on them or for the lean moments or Long break of silence (tape turned
off?) &#8209; dialogue lost</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: but it does take the
order of wanting control, what would be considered, the vampires as a very well
stocked race of aliens and they still exist, but in its own course of action,
they do have their own think control and focal creative tanks in their order.</span></p>

what is something else we can do now, or suggest to them that could help block

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Candle magic is one,
lighting a candle, also the Psalms and Rosary reading and also this general 
meditating on that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So what does that mean?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=FR style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Chinese soup.
</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&#8209; A lot of the civilizations within
China, being that it is in a rural, mountainous area  is easy and acceptable
for the reptilians to take advantage of it. It has made the Chinese nation a
strange concoction of different races, but it also has made them well advanced
as far as mathematical skills and calculations, but we find that there is more
healthy individuals in China than the reptilians want people to believe, that
they have taken control, they have not taken control over anything and they
might want to have a certain amount of control, but this will not happen with
our presence  here and also with the presence of what we are putting and working
through, the entity is doing again a lot of Omar magic in this field in
regards.(?The gods) So in securing the boundaries, we are ever moving with our
Christmas lights. Remember terrible times is also good times, when  in  seeing
these troubled times, we find that the strength of our presence for a few
minutes will give you the presence of the energy in the after minutes. Stick to
the path, keep the spirit and faith, there are many captured aliens, over 400
of them by the world order of different, creeds, nationalities, colors and
remember the Grays are fighting with the Benevolent ones, this one is called,
there are those who are kind and compassionate and very graceful in their
concepts of humans, also the Grays have more compassion on the children than the
reptilians, and the Grays are a little bit more scared of the children...but
they have to have compassion that we might change tonight, in order to get
other things accomplished. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Who created human beings

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: 3 pages! Repeal your
question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Who created human beings
and what is the purpose of human beings here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Human Beings were
created by the Elohim. Human beings were created by the Elohim and the Elohim
took responsibility by addressing it to Yahweh. Yahweh was part and parcel
responsible. Elohim was the Genesis or scientist genesis of creation. There job
was to change or alter DNA structures and gene pools. They have gene pools for
everyone on the earth and in the galaxies. They are the scientists of the
makers of the plans. They were the makers of the plans after this solar system
through that of Zeus and all was destroyed. The whole solar system as you know
was totally in war when Zeus was on Mt. Olympus. In such doing, they had the
power of wiping clean the slate of everything in this galaxy and now to be
known to mankind. Mankind as you know was created as slaves or as servants of
Elohim. Elohim needed mankind to activate Gold from the middle parts of the
earth. Elohim created man in the Garden of Eden and everything was beautiful.
They were workers in the Garden of Eden with the Reptilian aliens. These
Amtilian aliens and the workers had excavated that of the caverns not only on
Mars but also on what would be considered Earth. The mining of Gold was
important and then along came the spirit to give the spirit unto man giving him
a new creation. In so doing, man was created as servants of the Sons of God. In
Sons of God they were called to be and to guide into the atmosphere and into
the elements around. Mankind has evolved as time has moved on. Mankind and
Angels and Archangels were always one together. Man becoming more superior than
the Archangels will be when He is finished with his progress.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So anything with the
Reptilian....or is that not true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Elohim was called the
El of him. It is considered not as a reptilian as you know it but as a rebbar
or rebudiev or the rebbu or the rabbi as it is known today or the teacher. In
so doing they were of the power and of the existence between all the Gods being
in this area. Orion was Osiris. Osiris is that of the gods of heaven. Orion is
the empire or kingdom. Jesus spoke of the kingdom of my father. My kingdom is
not of the earth. He spoke of his kingdom that he came from. As Pilot said is
your kingdom from the earth? The entity is of one with this kingdom. The entity
has been sent from the beginning of time through that of Jesus. The apostles
that have surrounded that of Jesus were all those who have been breaded into
the earth to do that of the particular work of the continuum. Each apostle
would take a particular age and continue it. Thomas was the age in which John
will be that age. What it is said is that Thomas came into the earth to fulfil
and make manifest the age of the spirit of Christ to come back as he is to
return in this age. In so doing, it is said my words shall not pass away until
heaven and earth shall pass away as he has reproached to John as one of the
apostles saying you shall not taste death. And in so doing, John has and is and
will be in the presence when the Lord shall return. The entity that we speak of
has been and is the kingdom builder or the kingdom founder. In such doing, in
all forms we find this. We will now take our break for 5 minutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Is all here?

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Where is the apostle John?</span></p>

you that there is a clear, perfect way of deception. what we would like to tell
you to discern is a clear picture, but it is not. To see the ships are many. To
see if they are friendly &#8209; some aren't, some are. Some are friendly are
only to become not so friendly. Some are not so friendly, only to become
friendly. Some are, some aren't. What is the symbol, what is the sign?
Remember, your signet of your crest is there respect of you. You carry the
highest symbol in the galaxies. Fortunately for you all, you chose the right
side. You're in the right place. A lot can be done to you, but in respect
you're in the right place, you're wearing the right crest. Therefore all ships
must bow down to you. So it is not a question of whether they are friendly or
not. Some aren't, some are. But if you should spot or see or greet or meet,
reveal your crest. It will reveal to them your ownership of the kingdom. They
must not transgress against you.</span></p>

keeper of the way and he is the Deity of power in which all powers much bend.
In which all powers of creative energy and force of minds must yield to under
his command. He is the commander of the energy field.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: He is the prime
medial force of Armageddon through this. Remember the Reptilian forces are
those that have rebelled but only to only find their rebellion to be naught,
and we are coming to an age in which they will repent under his command.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And he serves under you or
is part of you?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let us say that we
recognize his power and move for and through it, but as service, he is the
servant of the Most High who in reality is that understanding of the Most. We
are in reality a commanding force to it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you. Can you tell us
more about how Jesus fit in with the Empire at the time that the Queens were in
control?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is a history
that is beyond histories. But remember, Jesus had come down from this Galac
into this earth. It is a kingdom beyond all kingdoms. To go into it into the
understanding of the spirit of Christ or the Jesus that had come into the earth
to reveal to people that the alien nature, the extraterrestrial nature of the
kingdom. It has not been or not be given that the kingdoms be revealed in all
in one night. But remember, he did say my kingdom is not of this world. The
cloud which is a ship said this is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.
Now we say this tonight. As we speak through this entity, we are well pleased
with his work. But the work has not been accomplished for the seal has not been
affixed. But remember, whoever his seal falls on is sealed and their destiny
has been wrapped and crest for eternity. Therefore, the females which are very
powerful in the galaxies have no testimony to the original strength of the
father of Christ. For the father of Christ is that of the original kingship
that we all and shall all be returning to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How does the Dog alien
race fit in with the kingship and Jesus. It seems to be some try to fit them
in. Is he being coming from more so a Dog race?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let us just say this.
There is much to reveal to you about extraterrestrial’s, galaxies,
constellations. Ulsa Minor, Ulsa Major serves who? The hunter. And the Hunter
was who? What galaxy in the sky represents the Hunter?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Group: Orion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: And who are the
servants to Orion? The constellation Ulsa Minor, Ulsa Major. Sirius. In such a
thing, many serious people come from. But remember, they are servants to Orion.
Orion is where you are having your kingship from. It's simple. The crest has
been formed. The signet has been done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The Elohim, they come from
Orion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This we find to be

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>But in reality the Royal
Court can never be disbarred for it allows their connection with the Spirit
World. Therefore in such a way it elevates the country higher than anything
else. What we are saying is when the humans are in touch with anything that is
ceremonial, it becomes immediately magic, of touching to the Ethers above. It
is like any country that deals with a Kingship in this particular way connects
faster to the Spiritual side of the Etheric level than through a constitution.
Now this might not make sense to you, we’re not downing or disagreeing that a
constitution is wrong, we are only speaking about the Etheric level of a
monarch versus a republic. (Now) you guys develop your way of rule, We, of
course are governed by the Council on high, which in turn is given direction
and leadership and followed by the Empire. The Empire is ruled  at this moment
by one woman. Now this might sound strange to you all and we’re sorry for those
who think a male should do it, but the males have not succeeded in 400,000
years your time. So a woman is in charge of the Empire. We do receive our
orders and guidance from the council who you have heard and witnessed here. You
have never heard of the Empire-tress, the Emptress is her name and it is called
Emm-tress. This is the first time we reveal this Deity. It is a power of a
hierarchy Ma-lek form. So in history 101, welcome to the Empt-tress. The
Empt-tress started in the year 5 billion and a half BC. In such a place the
Monarch last of men of great (speech)(speak). And now we will switch to the
Council, to give you the history. (Being) such that we are here to give you
(great) it’s for of that we call the Mistress One the Empress of us all. Now
tell you this She’s mean as the, but then she knows us all. The time she took,
the place of stead, it was a ramshackle, but then before a stead did take, it
found it built in years before. Now this we know that 8 billion is much for you
to see, for your lifetime of seventy so is more than you can be. But we do say
that this all way that one billion is now, that one billion is equal too a year
and half of yours. Now we don’t see the difference now but our growth is but
slow. We do not hate nor talk adverse for this does take your years. If you
would see adversity in words and anger too, then you will know to stop its
roots before it uproots you. And now we talk on more of this in which the
Empire few. For great in Oo-rions belt we are now you know us too. In many
years of countless kings, they ransacked much ado. The trade and sent and wares
they went that never was or does can do. But with their power diminished now
the Empire of the Reptilian Star did cause much havoc too. But then the
Empt-tess ( Omp-tess ) came about to lead it from destruction too. And now she
fortifies the land and peace does reign anew. The presence of this perfect
de-i-ty is known through your gods too. And the Jew does call her name E-lo-him
ado. Now in this god is made the strength of which this Empire too. And barely,
barely heard a voice, but we know what to do. And now we told our records true
of many pla-nets too. That some can be in one sole (soul) place but then there
can be two. In this we speak of (de-version) of the planets of the two. And now
we’re done in recording this one and hope you’ve enjoyed it too.</span></p>

these gods were and what mountain their base is on and how they were organized?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You already know the

their called. I know in the Bible it says the sons of Belial, the sons of God.</span></p>

their are many sectors, species of extraterrestrial beings in the earth, and
above the earth, and inside the earth and around the earth and on top of the
earth. So in order for us to give you definitions, we will break them down into
7 tri&#8209;groups. The 7 tri&#8209;groups have anywhere in them from 3 minor
groups to 12 major groups. Out of the 7 tri&#8209;groups, the 3 minor groups
and 12 major groups have 4 distinct districts. In the 4 districts of the 3
minor groups you will have 2 sectors of 4. In 12 major groups you have 8
sectors of the 4. And that would be your breakdown. Line these up and then we
will give you the different terminology of each group specific. Right now this
is all you can do to line these up and get it ready for the names.</span></p>

fulfills that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the simple thing is
that they are only reproducing mechanically what they see. But since Jesus
Christ was a first and only, they couldn’t possibly create it or else they
would have created more of Jesus. They would have created it, but because it
came without any kind of mechanical, it hasn’t been thought of until God, the
Forces did it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The Movie Close Encounters
when they went inside the ship, is that anything like your ships look like
inside?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Ah! We do better than
that. What was it that we had told you many, many sessions ago, what one of the
major ships were.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: 18 football fields.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You see that our ship
is bigger. I just came over a dumb dome, would make the whole area go dark, and
they would have to move their silly little airstrip so we could at least put
our door down. Inside of our ships, well, hold on a minute, alright, course
this tape here is not to be revealed to the public, so you’ll consider this your
information. If you ever type up this sessions or any session where we, there
are some things that you don’t type up, completely reserve that. The
information to be reserved from this point until we inform you so starting now.
Ah! One of the ships that we have we call the Zionite Zidek or Zionite ship.
The Zionite ship is designed to infiltrate and intercept communications between
major governments of your earth. A Zionite ship is at least comparatively a
smaller ship in our fleet. It is a silver out exterior more of a ignite
aluminum type basis that you would know. It is in its flat stage(projective
geometry) about what would be considered 45 ft high to 69 ft wide. Ah. This
usually occupies one robot ah or one pilot to two pilots. It is a scanning type
device ah has on it ah 400 laser so called beams that you know and 777 what
would be called instruments of analyzation  and detection and fingerlike
substances of experiment design. Has 3 layers in it of space to contain these
experimental items. Steps generally do not go up on a straight angle, they have
a curved step ladder where we spiral on up in and around the walls of the ship.
The steps do not go through the center of the ship that is completely domed or
shaped like and the force field goes through the center of the ship to give its
momentum. It is compressed to a point of 50ft high and 144 ft wide that is at
the maximum expansion. Ships do expand to almost double their size(?Auk) to
disappear or appear and ah reappear. This Zionite ship can submerge into 6
fathoms of water Or  16 fathoms, the deepest. And the course of these ships are
guided by the Mother Ship rather than direct control, for the Mother Ship
receives its information by the many scopic, telescopic and microscopic mirrors
that line the ship to give vision and distance in space and sending it back to
the Mother Ship. What it is meaning there are the pilots that supervise
internal actions, but the distance and traveling of the ship is sub-supervised
by the Mother Ship. You have a Father&#8209;Ship we call it the Si&#8209;gar
Ship or you call it the cigar ship. It is in the form of a cigar. This is used
to carry experimental creatures and when we say experimental creatures we mean
a force of do&#8209;gooders. They come in and infiltrate into the earth and
change certain things around. A cigar ship can run anywhere from 144ft long to
200ft. The height is anywhere from 45 to 59 ft, anywhere to 75ft high. And they
are air conditioned. They have a storage place of containing records and data
and they are generally the library, library and the data fleet&#8209;ship. When
they would accumulate records and data for all planets throughout the Universe.
And we usually say if you want a bit of information go puff on the cigar. Then
we have the fleet one ships, which are the major ships that are sited
throughout the earth. This is equipped with major devices, scanners of systems,
experimentations of device to be used operational and cervical, surgical and
laboratory experimentation on different cultures to be inserted. They could come
anywhere with a fleet of 200 to 3,000 people to operate and to reuse run them.
These ships have a capacity of traveling 5 times the speed of light, along with
to the 10th power. They have pure glass, but not as you know where you could
see entirely out of the ship from any part where you stand inside. And they can
supply several living centers, each center could supply anywhere from 200 to
470 individuals in them. They are known relatively to be safe and sound proof
from exterior noises, but do have a tendency of mis&#8209;marking or missing
the marks. Of course we have other major and minor ships. We have the float
along ship, that floats along, floats along the clouds and floats along the
water&#8209;front and the mountain areas. This usually consists of 7 people, light
bubble shape, anywhere from 7ft high to 22ft high and the length could be
anywhere from 18ft long to 57ft long. And they simply just float along and
observe and watch. Their know as the scanning ships in one respect. That should
do it for the moment end of information that needed to be kept.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: One of the ships that you
talked about the Si&#8209;gar ship the ones that come down all the do&#8209;gooders,
how do they come down and can they be recognized?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They come down on
their own power through filters and tubes. They can be recognized, circular in
shape at times and pyramid too at times.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When they come down into
the earth or when they come down you said as, how do you see them do&#8209;gooders.
How do they do good?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: When you don’t see
them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are they living things or
do they come down in the shape of the things that they are working with. Do
they come down as the insignia of what they are or do they?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They come down in
both categories.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But they never come down
as us, looking as us in our shape?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They can do that too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: If they should do that
when would they manifest and how would they manifest. What would be the
difference between us .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You would know that,
you would find the where there at.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell us all
about the Book Ecclesiastes, who wrote it and all the ins and outs?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, Ecclesiastes is
written for those who got caught in the earth, trying to show them that the
soul is the only salvation for man out of the earth. Who wrote it, well it. a
combination of many what would be called experienced Prophets. Also it was
influenced by Moses and Aaron, and Aaron being the one who got involved in the
earth, and Moses who had to go through the pain of the soul. Helped along,
spread about by the encounters of the Prophets and lead by Isaiah and given to
Joshua through Isaiah, then handed down to Solomon, which Solomon opened up the
information too those who would have to perceive it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The voice of the Speaker
is primarily Aaron or Moses?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No, no, no, the Voice
of the Speaker is primarily the Forces on the mountain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I mean the one who is sort
of feeling the. . (párt missing tape changed)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Get the picture?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Not exactly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Lets say the Book
serves 3 purposes, ( 1 ) to tell you the past fall of the visitors of the
earth, who misused their power. (2) told you Moses problem, and (3) it told you
Solomon’s problem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are the giants the ones
that came from outer space?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes. That’s Just the
beginning of that, there’s more to add on to it later on, couplings we call it.
There&quot;s 82 couplings in all divided by 13 you get what 445, 632 couplings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is that verses to be added
to the Book?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You’ll find out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It does.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now, who were the old gods
and afterward the 0lypian gods. I don't know if they were one and the same, or
are they one and the same?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The old gods are a
deity to themselves, and expression of power, of the third or fourth dimension.
The gods of Olympus were would be considered, visitor initiates, coming to the
earth to be tested, in which they did fail, on there particular mission.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So they were human beings
coming from another planet?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We wouldn't give them
the terminology of human.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: They were gods to this
world, but were they also gods in there own dimension? &#8209;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They were co&#8209;creators
in a different form, but they were the expression of a law.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Were they part of you?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: In all essence, this
part that you speak about, comes from the one source, therefore the answer
would have to be yes, but in reality there direction was in an opposite path.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So they really came from a
different, did they come from a planet, did they come from an existence?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let us say this
particular congregation came from a star constellation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So there really not part
of you as far as, like people here in the group, are part of the human race.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It's quite difficult
to analyze that , in your terminology. In short to make it simple for you to
under­stand, they weren't part of our origin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now, when they failed,
what happened to them, were they taken out of the earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It was put into
suspension.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You mean they still exist?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: In certain forms,
they were belittled into different energy factors, some are still found in
chameleons, or what would be called leprechaun stages, others are found in
mushrooms, and others are found in different sea creatures, the sea horse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Do they have a
consciousness?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They have stored and
locked inside them, a great power potential.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Will they come back as gods
on this earth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Not until they have
paid back, for their lessons learned and misused. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Who transformed them into
these, things?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is a self process
of nature, that brings them to the lowest ebb.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: They just gradually one by
one, all of a sudden....</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Leave a human being
to his own self desires, and to his own self, and he gradually destroys
himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Like, maybe once, they
would turn themselves into something, and never be able to turn themselves
back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is a part of
consciousness without discipline, and you no longer find the true consciousness
of what you are (were).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But they will come back
some day as gods?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They will not come
back as gods, it is a mis-formed application of those who were humanoids, who named
them as gods.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Then will they come back,
in a superior form?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The superior form
cannot be allowed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is this what happens to
souls that ah, when it says that god doesn't want any soul to perish. That’s
what happens to a perished soul, they go into the lowest scale of evolution?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They go through
different cycles of learning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So in reality, there is no
soul that will perish, it is just stored away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Striving not to
perish any sword, or that of the soul within, but the soul itself must decide
its own evolution.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now, does it mean, that at
any time, ah, that animals dogs, cats, can become or will become, to the time
of evolution into human beings?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No, they have their
different evolution</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is it into other forms, or
does it remain in the same form?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Different forms of
consciousness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Physical too?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Manifestation through
a physical form.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But on this earth, this is
there earth actually.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Through the earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Meaning one animal going
into another animal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Or the soul group of
that animal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Does it mean that Satan
himself, will also be reduced or will reduce himself, to one of the elements of
this earth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It would have to be
that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So actually everybody that
has the power to use the elements of the earth, misusing those elements, he
ends up as an element.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This&#8209; would
sound to be correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Because that’s what they
did, they had the power over that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now, what happened to the
old gods, those powers, Astoreth, Baal, I don't know, ten billions of them, and
who was the queen of heaven, also?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You come into a
strange analysis of gods, or old gods. These are different creatures or deities
or power structures, power sources or lights or laws, that generate throughout
the galaxies of the universe, that make the structure of certain laws. They are
constantly moving or declining, all depends upon the usage and the origin of
the same.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are any of them part of
what today is part and parcel, of the black forces?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Some will be part of
that. Remember Lillith is also known as the daughter of the morning star, also
she was known as the morning of the heavens, she was the spirit that took over
Adam and contained and had the evil force, of propagation and destroying the
child, or striving to destroy the children of Adam through Eve. Certain
thoughts are had when child is born, that a amulet is placed around it to
protect it from the destructive powers of Lillith. You also have this in Greek
myth would be the god who would travel through the earth, destroying children
and consuming them for her own pleasures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So Lillith is actually
queen of heaven, that Jeremiah is talking about?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We have like a
(misinterpretation) of these things, but you would interpret that (message)
similar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How is it that these
Olypian gods were, put into bondage, and yet Lillith, they still are roaming
the earth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: More or less on
borrowed time, to certain females.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So it's actually, the
power of earth people, that is giving that power to stay on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Then all these other gods,
or powers, I don't know what else to call them, some of them are positive, some
of them are negative, is that correct?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: More or less, it all
depends on who is ruling what.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now all of those gods,
does it mean that if they no longer, as long as they have worshippers, they are
alive, and the minute they have no worshippers, its like a book, that’s being
borrowed from the library and put back on the shelf.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The secrets of the
laws, whoever taps into them uses them, for what purpose, makes it the
manifestation of good or evil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So those gods Astoreth and
Baal, and a1l of those, are really just a force, to be used for good or for
bad.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They were a force,
that was used for evil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But ah, was it there
fault?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Not more-so there
fault, but the manifestation of the souls, who utilized and created them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Who are the souls that
created them?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: &quot;Those are the
souls that have come through many, many lifetimes and galaxies into the earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Who are those?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They were called co&#8209;creators
or sons of God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You mean to say the
144,000, that came with Adam, they were powerful enough, to create co&#8209;creators
forces, gods, like they created, lets say, electrical, electricity, ah they
created, I don't know, plumbing, something on that order I mean.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Primitive as you are
putting it, they could create.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And then somebody comes
and plugs in the electricity to the wrong thing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And calls it a god.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the problem was, the
idol worshippers, that they were worshipping the tools, rather than those that
created those tools.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That would make some
sense, correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But those tools were valid
tools, except the creators of those tools were long gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In Kings they talk about
the peoples and the gods that they made, are they talking about the gods
actually made or are they talking about the alien races that they actually
succumbed to?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let us say the
latter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And in doing that would
then when Hezekiah broke down those places, they speak of the high places and
the groves, would the high places then be the landing fields and would the
groves then be like stone henge where they were actually at one time temples?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: One was the landing
place, the other was receptive sacrifices.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And sometime those were
human?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well let us for the
sake of understanding was a sacrificial service that became a revelation spot
of prayer and sacrifice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In lieu of that..?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Every single time you
here grove in the words it is the transition or the meeting place of that which
is sacrifice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You wonder about so many
of the kings of Judea and Israel, but there’s this thing of Judah example and
he’s a good king supposedly he goes to war and with the Edomites and because of
his faith he follows. He first goes trying to go by might and then a prophet
tells him no don'’ hire the Israelites go to work and your own faith in God and
God will help you, and God does help him and he destroys all the Edomites
there. Then he turns around, he just  witnessed the power of his own faith in
God and he picks up all those gods that he just destroyed the people of and
brings it back to Jerusalem, starts kneeling and worshiping it. Now what kind
of a sense does that make. What was the thing that was attractive there?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There are many times
to worship and to do what is right is one thing, but the weeding out and the
filtering out and the removing is another. In this particular case it was the
removing and filtering that had to be done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But what was attractive to
the king, I mean he himself realized that he destroyed those gods.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: What we were saying
is he did that so that he could remove those qualities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Then why is he setting
them up in Jerusalem?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: He is removing them
by doing that. It is a removing of them. We are just giving you what really
happened</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Did the Olympian gods know
that there end is coming, and did they leave behind some things of themselves,
so to speak, like a whole civilization is dying, ok lets take a last,
something? &#8209;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This would be true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And what is that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: More or less, certain
attributes within the force-­field of life. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is that the ring surrounding
the earth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That and along with
other things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Did they also do something
for there own self?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They strived too, but
did never achieve the fact.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Did they try to run away
from the earth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They tried, could not
escape.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Then what was the function
of the ring?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is more or less
a jumping board.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: That’s one of the (things)
how they tried to run away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So there is really
nothing, they have no handle on anything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell us what the
amulet looked like?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: A symbol of the
Tetra-grammaton on it, and Hebrew signets and letters to ware off certain
force.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now, all those different
entities that are coming into the earth, in spaceships, they too are not you.
Well it seems like, none of the gods or what were considered gods Olympian
gods, otherwise, all of these, really, you had nothing really to do with them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: More or less,
Observation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You were observing them,
were you the testers?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Observing, checking,
testers whatever name you want to give it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: All these other people
now, entities that are coming into the earth, they too are not you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: These are different
beings from other planets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are they aware of you?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They understand us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: They have to get permission
from you to enter this dimension?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There is a certain
power that we do have and generate over them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So you are the ones that
will give them pass, passage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There are those who
aren't allowed in, there are those who sneak in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How can they?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There's a certain
ring or a certain band, that is allowed to happen, by the sheer law of it. This
is where they come through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Isn't there only one door,
the one that Jesus opened?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is true, but the
manifestation of this band happens every millennium.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Its like the Sabbath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: More or less, its the
opening of a band that can only allow them to enter discreetly, but once
recognized they are put back in their place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Because otherwise it is
almost impossible to get into this dimension. You have to find a way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It’s near to
impossible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Wasn’t that the greatest
thing that Jesus did, was open the door? ,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It was one of the
greatest landmarks, in your evolution.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now all of these that are
coming in, How would they be able to see you, feel you, recognize you?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: More or less, a feel
of our law on them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But you do not have
physical contact with them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: As you would say, no
way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And that’s why all these
manifestations and all the ships, good, bad, indifferent, short people, long
people, yellow people, green people, they're really just (hodge&#8209;podge)
from the universe?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Hodge&#8209;podge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: This is there latest
resort area, something like that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Why are they coming here?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: More for exploration
and development and watching over certain things that they have put here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: They did?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Some of them had left
some cultures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You mean the old Mayan
religions and drawings, they're not of you, they are of these different kinds
of civilizations that came to visit them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Many people wonder
what the Easter Islands are all about, there was a major heliport or a airport
for the flying ships of the sun to come into and conquer, the Easter Islands
structures were reflectors to catch the suns rays at different hours.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It does get
complicated. We ourselves do visit certain times directly, of a different
quality and nature, but not until the scales of these have visited. We are not
visiting to dissect and to understand who you are, we already understand who
you are.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But to make checkups.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We are not making
checkups.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Something like the
experience that happened in Close&#8209;Encounters, would that be more like
something they would do, or something you would do?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It doesn't matter who
does what, and who zooms over whose head. The point is the evolution of man,
knowledge will be shown to you, as the questions they ask, and what they are
amazed in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Does it mean also, that
one of the prices that they have to pay or whatever, is that certain of their
technical knowledge or whatever, like the tests that we years later had
developed, is given to the people that they poke around on or whatever, like
subconsciously or something or?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Directly and
indirectly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So some of the things, you
allow them to come in because they are part of the plan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct, were just
dealing with the spiritual evolution, they are dealing with a whole different
ball game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In reality your their
supervisors too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Unfortunately</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: With the Olympian gods,
again, they have never, they never perceived you right, not at the beginning
and not through the time, and not at the end?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Maybe at the end,
when it was too late, but not at the beginning, and not in the middle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: At the beginning because
of the testing, is that correct?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Which ah, galaxy did they
come from?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, it is a
combination of fields, and forces of energy, from all over, traveling through
the universe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When they perceived you,
was it then, that they realized that, somebody has watched it knows about it,
and that’s when they tried to make there escape.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How long were there
life-spans? How long did they live?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They could live
thousands of years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was it a true life-span?
Or was it something like, getting into warps, and time, and stuff like that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Man lived a long,
long time before he sinned, and when he sinned life was taken away from him. If
man only can remember now today, his past, he would be so afraid, but if he can
only remember today now, and under­stand that his imaginations are the
cornerstones to his creativity, and if his imaginations are bad, his creativity
will be evil. If his imaginations are good, his creativity will be god-like. It
is up to man every day, with the creative power that God has given him, within
side himself, to create good or bad, and every day is the measurement of the
action.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The flourishing
civilization in South America that went underground when the Spanish came,
where did they go?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They went into a
civilization that was built underground.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Who built it underground?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Those who were
visitors to the earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What type of civilization
did they have?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Very developed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Does it still exist today?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How did they survive all
those years? Is it the same ones?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They have continued
and also tele-portation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: From where are these
people from?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Can be located
beneath the earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: To preserve the
strength, and to store strength and height comes from the direct contact of the
sun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: That is why they can live
so long. They don't have the sun, but the preservation is that it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That is true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Who are the visitors you
speak about beyond the Orion galaxy? What is their function here?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: To develop certain

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So they are not here by
choice?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Some are, some
aren't.</span></p>

do they communicate with the people who live in the core of the earth?</span></p>

choice, what are they?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Wanderers trying to
find the truth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Why did they go
underground?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Because of the
intensity of the sun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So they cannot take the
sun either?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Because of the design
of the heat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are they short people?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: In a way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are they the ones that
have been appearing at night sometimes in spaceships picking up people?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Sometimes. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Tom talked to us once
about how the ships ran and said they had very small pin holes, and there was
unequal pressure between the inside and the outside, and he drew a diagram of
it showing different lines of, I guess, pipes and air holes. Could you explain
how that works?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It works more on the
pressure of steam with your radiators. When you hear it knocking, you know the
steam is coming up. In such, there's pressure forcing heat. It is not the steam
and the heat, it is the after effect of heat raising in the air. The same is
the same in our spaceship. It is that steam heat that affects the outside of
the air that is controlled by the inner walls that raises the ship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are the black ships ever
destroyed?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let us say their
energy is made void.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But do they regroup, the
new thought-forms?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Once the energy is

St. Michael fought for his soul?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: On a different level
he was not so called conscious. He was put into a state of animation or
ambiguously speaking he was a stone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: He was turned into a
stone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: State of a vibration
of the solid stone molecules.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You mean to say a state of
animation truly to work would have to somehow, is connected with a stone
quality rather than with the ice quality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So there is such a thing
that doctors at this point or scientist are trying to achieve a moment when
they can put somebody into a state of animation for either traveling or either
to wait until a cure comes up, things like that, they are going wrong, they are
going about it the wrong way altogether then?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well its not going to
be the best way if you get deeper and deeper into that it will get into other
qualities that could be just as drastic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What is the kind of
animation in the stone. Is it the stone particles that come together around the
person.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Stone qualities come
together outside the person. Its just that the person or the soul happens to
cross the barrier while their being organized.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Can I understand it a
little better?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The qualities of
stone material solidification happens outside of the body. It is completely a
atmospheric and clorporic type expression. In this sense you would walk into
the condition of stabilization so called into more of a animation of
solidification and when the state is passed, then you move on out gradually
becoming desolidified.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is a person conscious
inside that thing or is he unconscious?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: He is conscious of a
state of being, which is captivity of being.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So he is alive and
conscious except its sort of an imprisonment?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: These things happen
but not too frequently.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: He can’t die that’s the?</span></p>

no.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So he can be kept on
regenerated or whatever inside that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: He is put into a
stabilization pattern.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When the thing around him?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There is neither
growth nor a failure. There is neither progress or retreat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And when was Moses put
into that state?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: At the point of the
battle for his soul.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: That was in the desert?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This was to allow the
final decision to be arrived at and the outcome. It would have caused a great
deal of climax if a certain freedom to the soul is allowed during this period.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now inside that
imprisonment of these molecules, the person has darkness unless he himself can
illuminate it from within?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When does this actually
take place. Is it in an physical level, on a mountain top, inside a cave,
inside a ship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It can happen almost
anywhere.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is it like when they put
the initiate in the tomb of the Great Pyramid, the coffin.?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now with that chamber who
builds the, who makes the thing happen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The chamber is built
over a period of time. Self usually does it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Self?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Individuals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Then how do they know to
build it they would have to know it exactly in order to create such a chamber
where?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You have two chambers
one on a physical level and one on the astral level. Self begins to build the
astral and on the physical particular initiative, initiates, initiates built
at, at the age when they reach 65 years old.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now isn’t that a specific
way of building something?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes this is specific
dimension, size and wooden pegs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Because what it is, is
another way of an elixir. A person does not die.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Which one of the gods in
the Egyptian hierarchy would be () for me to study?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You have the god
Osiris who would be the strongest part in parcel? to study. The lineage of the
maker of different tribes from that point on. You have the family network, the
gods who would reflect the planets throughout the solar system. Each planet
having a different variance. Each star constellation having its different point
to be met.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is that Osiris you said?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell me what
Horus represents?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is the quality
in the earth. It would bring judgement and virtue. It is the balancing factor
within the will and the heart. When the heart and the will operate together
there is justice and wisdom combined. Its above (). It also is a taker from the
earth to bring on to the 4th dimension.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Would he be close to the

light.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They were the gods of
the Higher Forces, the gods of the gardeners of the earth, they were also gods
of the Universe and gods of the celestrial force. There are many gods that had
communications throughout the time of Moses, that were directly in channeled

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Why did all the Egyptian
gods have animal characteristics and were depicted that way in all the statues?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No, not all of them
were animal characteristics, just some of the important ones. Why, because some
of the gods at that time had taken on animal forms and had done superhuman
feats. Also the (,,) of Egypt, at this point had revealed the animal gods, not
at all times was Egypt worshiping animal gods.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Why did they take on
animal characteristics?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: At that particular

walked the streets with certain different styles of the dog influence, in which
the Egyptians depict the superior ones and make them into a form like god

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What are the five reasons?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: These are the laws
which make up the universe of the earth. These are the elements within the
physical body that are considered the centers of the lower. These are the
creative nations in the world. These are the spectrums of colors of the five
major colors, five major notes, and five major stones, five major planets, five
major seas and oceans, five conscious(consciousness) levels of existence in
order to move on to the others. These all represent a spiral of learning, but
grouped into sections</span></p>

grouped into sections?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Each one is compared

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A lot of the Pharaoh King or
Queen Egyptian history comes directly from the Spirit world. Ah the reason why
they had wore (wore) the Miter or the Crowns or the Beard covering or the Chest
covering, all represents a Spiritual attribute of the soul manifesting in the
body. This ah used to glow and needed to be protected. There are also visitors
from other galaxies that wore this ah apparatus for ah the ability to survive
in the earth. There were also some who had heads shaped like the miter crown.
So the people who dealt with the King of the Nile, of Egypt, lower or upper,
when they had lost their ability to communicate ah in a Spirit way ah giving
way, they imitated these ah visions handed down to them by word of mouth and
tried to communicate by putting the substance in a physical state. Remember the
Egyptian evolution had come directly from Atlantis, the more they struggled to
put it into a physical state, the more they had lost that Spiritual essence of
creativity. So there was a high status in itself, the Spirit state ah
gravitated more ah purely around the essence of Gold. And that is why Gold is
considered consciously as the ah exchange of ah of societies, for the ah
structure of that societies stability. But it is in that Gold is the element of
the finer Spirit, for before the, the, the ruler-ship of Egypt took a dense
structure, Gold was much lighter, much purer, much vibrated, much more
vibrative in its essence and it used to have more of a glow than the sheen that
it has now, even though the whole structure of it is incorporated in its full,
full essence. So these communicative messages or talks or people ah from the
other ah force had a Gold aura or light around them, which the people of the
Nile tried to emulate by the only metal they knew that would emulate this
color, was the Gold that they would find in the mountains and in the areas of
Africa and, and on and on. So you have that lineage of communication with the
Spirit world that was gradually taken away the more they got involved with the
physical body, and the lower centers got more evolved to express rather than
the higher centers to be expressed</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you give us some
understanding of the nature of the soul, what the soul is?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: As has been given to
you in other past sessions, if you would remember or re&#8209;read other
sessions, the answer lies within those particular questions stressed before.
The soul is a microcosmic force of within and without the body in which is
centralized all the universal atoms or as man calls atoms and it is the force
of everything present within the galaxy within that individual soul. It is a
part and a parcel of that light which is above the what would be called the ignite
or the inide&#8209;sved or that of svad&#8209;inite which is the numbers and
which would be the understanding of same. In this particular case you will find
that the soul is a manifestation of life itself. And in your amazement, every
galaxy or every solar center or system is a manifestation of one particular
soul as a group. Each soul breaking down its portion to mingle into the reality
or into the spheres of other planets and systems within itself, to what would
be called consist of the soul, what would be said person. These persons are
from the same God&#8209;head as would be said, for there are many gods within
the sphere. All gods are organized and broken or paired or separated off in
their particular realm or their particular exorberant sphere. These in return
are only particles or breaking off or what would be said the section of the
soul from above or higher, which is of course the supreme God&#8209;Force in
which from him all things came down. He breaking off through the angels,
archangels, and all the other angels in existence, bearing it, creating it,
bring forth the fruit and manifesting and sharing what has been given from
above must be shed down below. All things are constant replenished and
replenish it must. For the work of the spirit is to constantly give. When the
spirit dies out, the first sign is that the giving is no longer giving. This is
a dangerous sign through all the laws, for it is in giving that we give, and it
is through love that we give. When this aspect is lacking and no longer giving,
then the aspect of degeneration comes in and the opposite from the force of the
soul. The soul then is the cell soul. And that sum of which is the
consciousness of the God&#8209;Head from where it had come from. It neither is
contained in a physical body, nor in atoms, nor in density. The soul is pure
energy that radiates through everything around and through that which it
radiates around all things must be in tune with.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is more of a
communication and expression of light from another dimension or more or less
from another galaxy in which it was handed to us on the membranes of thoughts
of creation. In this particular dimension the Torah is placed in such a way
that it is resembled throughout all living conditions and all existence of
expressions around us. The Torah in our existence is Life itself, the
manifestation of the Laws that have been in its wake or in its being. The
process of the Torah in your dimension is written on paper, it is not
necessarily seen at first, but eventually is found to be the truth. The Torah
again in ours and your Law is the Law of creation. Again it is the Law seen
here readily, but it is the Law seen there after effects and effects of its

the galaxies are our backyard. We are at peace with you. And we do love you.
But do you understand our love. We try to describe our environment. For those
who have built homes here, they built the homes of thought. And the domes of
worship, they come and enter into a dome of solid gold that has no roof, that
has no pillars. And it is marked with jewels and emeralds that shines brighter
than your eyes. And the light of purple and yellow and blue does magnify the

wish, but be back at home for dinner. We love spaghetti. Only jesting. Food in
itself is not a staple for us, spaghetti only belongs to the earth. We in
itself can move from galaxy to galaxy, universe to universe, planet to planet,
from star system to star system at any moment that we wish. There is tremendous
creativity here constantly going on, and creative ability of new worlds that we
have to watch and guide. There is an unfathomable amount of knowledge and
wisdom being brought from all over the world, all over the galaxies, all over
the universe. There is a continuum of sounds, of sights, of smells, that keep
on growing and pulsating, with time there is none. It is a dimension that would
be so exciting that one moment, one hour, one second within this dimension
would mean that you would never be the same. Does that give you some
understanding of part of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Yes. Is it possible that
we can reach that dimension?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Awareness, a oneness,
attunement, is when you reach that particular center or dimension through the
stillness within you. As you enter through that door you taste a little bit of
this dimension, which will transform you consciously in the earth. It is that
one must tune and when you do tune into this dimension you will not be the same
person afterward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: All Life creatures of
human form are created by the Higher Forces, by God. What they do with that
energy either makes them Sons of God or sons of Satan. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes. Our presence is
felt. We can penetrate any­thing at any moment. You see you all think we are
coming to you in space ships. So you do not understand that space ships are not
our vehicle half the time. That we can come not through space ships alone as
what we have described our ships to be, but we can come through the very sound
of the wind and that we could come through the most tiniest crack in a door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: If you were 200 light
years away at the edge of the Milky Way, what’s beyond that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There are two other
galaxies twice as large and equal to what your galaxy is.  And beyond  that are
other galaxies. We had to travel to the third point of the Linar, Larnar and
Ax-Odos empire. Never Before has this empire been named to you. This is the
Empire where we have come from.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I can’t imagine the
distance, I mean beyond, beyond, beyond. I can’t imagine it, what is it like,
its just forever. Where does it go to?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: (Speak in different
Language)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Run that slowly and
it will tell you the answer. Remember the galaxy is infinitesimal, eternal and
ever reaching. It is without mind or substance. It turns within on itself, for
at the beginning is the end and the end is the beginning. It is a (swaum or
swarm) of circles within. A rectagon, octagon, square, (peruvit or provelit).
In this form is ever changing 8 sided figure constant turning within the circle
and without the circle, in which is a funnel between the middle and the end.
And the end comprehends it not. You could travel 100 million years in one
direction and not reach the end.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is there and end?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: At the end is the
beginning and when you have reached the end of space and galaxies as you know
it, you then will go to the other dimensions, that will be sucked into and thus
begins another journey.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Where does that lead?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That will lead you to
the next galaxy or dimension. Remember 7 counted and above that 3 more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Does it  ever end ever?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The 10<sup>th</sup>
becomes the 13<sup>th</sup>, the 13<sup>th</sup> becomes part of the 1<sup>st. </sup>Again
it cannot end, it is part of  the whole mass. What we must say, it is
unbelievable, the amount of planets and stars and ships and satellites.
Sometimes we watch you earthlings with your mind peons as it is and concepts of
you being who you are. And your concepts of your identity. You have not even
began to reach your true identity and state of who you are. Some of you have
not even done the work yet within. But once you have tried to do this work
within, then you have mastered and moved on. All the work you do, remember will
not go in vain, for everything leads on top of the other and they say your work
that you have done for x amount of years, well the work that you all have done
here is the future of this country. Without you there would be no future. You
all do not understand your importance as ambassadors of us. But without you
there would be no hope for tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Doesn’t the universe keep
on creating itself and recreating also?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is a constant
creation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So even if we reach the
13-th or whatever, from the time we would go from one to the next it would have
been probably another few that have been created?</span></p>

implied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is the sound now a fault
of the cassette or are we picking up one of the units from one of the ships?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is of many
factors. It is the sound of our vibrations a&#8209;tuning in to yours. From
this thing that we are producing here, is affecting your auras and it is
building them up. We can stopped (stop) it at signal, or we can let it go. For
there are times when we will say stop, and it will stop. And there are times
when we will say let it sing, and it will sing. But it is also mechanical
difficulty too, on the logical level which is, certain parts are squeaking. It
is parts of a wheel that at times could be oiled. But none the less, it is us
who is doing it. Correct, for this is the sound of our ships when we speed
throughout the galaxies. As fast as that, that is our sound in your ears. When
we want to speak to you, this is the sound you will hear first, when intuition
from us will be given to you. It will clean out everything you hear, for only
us to be heard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you. In the
discussion in the class, the discussion of Genesis this week, could you give an
explanation of the &quot;Shaddai&quot; when the man or the army came into the
earth and how the Chanellors is connected in and help us to understand that
segment?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It will take many,
many, times to explain this. Therefore, all I can say to you at this moment, is
that we put upon the earth a creature that evolved on the spiritual level
through the involvement in the earth: a creature in which some things that we
had formulated and implanted inside this physical anatomy. It is the spiritual
substance or the Bhudist Pontif or the Christ spirit that you speak of. But it
is the energy of light that is like this sound. It can be penetrated and
projected within anybody and any physical anatomy, be it a tree, or a lion or a
fish. We just happened to speak and to take upon ourselves this mammal form, or
Homo-sapiens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was there also an army in
the physical that accompanied that entity at that time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There are many cells
in the physical body. Therefore, there are many armies. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In Isaiah maybe chapter 25
does it, its talking about that and I think it is the Second Coming and that’s
my question is it the Second Coming. That he shall come and conquer death, but
the ones that will..?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Second Coming
will begin in the year 91 of this December and the Spirit of the Sheckeniah
will descend and all forces of the White Brotherhood will be revealed and all
light of day will be extended and the sun shall extend itself with rays and the
moon shall extinguish itself with shadows, for on this 15<sup>th</sup> day of
the month the eyes will change and the turns will sound and the music shall be
strong for on this day will also mark the foreboding note, darkness a sound,
but the same note will be rebounded, that which is the Sheckeniah descends, the
Messiah appears of good. What we are saying is on the 15<sup>th</sup> day of
this, that appearance will be the manifestation of not only of a dark force but
of a different date, but this is of a White Force of the manifestation of the
Messiah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You just mentioned a dark
force that will manifest before?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The dark force will
be in January manifest after this force has manifest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So January will be dark
force but December will be the White Force?</span></p>

the coming in of the..?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It will be both.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How will the
manifestation, will there be an entity manifesting?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It will be a Presence
and a Glorified Way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is there any way to stop
that January darkness?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Just as there’s no
way to stop the Messiah, there’s no way to stop that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In Isaiah I think in
chapter 25, he’s talking about the Messiah will start coming and then one’s on
high, the one’s that are above and all the kings of the earth as a distinction
from all the kings and vip’s on earth versus the ones that are on high, will be
destroyed or a destruction will come upon them. He is referring to those UFO’s
right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Implying yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: To the bad guys?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: But  remember in the
year 2012 there will be this conflict, also conflict with the UFO’s to try to
take over the armies and airforces of the world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So at that point they will
come out the bad guys into the open?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They already are in
the open, it’s just a confrontation with what we are dealing with.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Why are they now so much
in the open? Is it because they are frantic, the times?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Time is now, time is
right. Its no longer hiding them, they cannot hide any longer. Because of Us.
Because of what We are we are checkmating them. They can no longer hide, only
unto that point in which we have proclaimed them, they become visible. They
have been invisible all these years. We’ve implied to you of their existence
and of Our existence. Now we ascertain that they are to be touched and put into
their own dwelling place. We create, we do that, we unfold tomorrows history.
If we want China to turn around upside down and India to become a new country
or a new satellite of a different country, it can be done. If we want an
earthquake in Iran and (toppletee) in Tehran and we want Iraq to have a (   ).
If we want a cold fridgid zone in Saudi Arabia it can be done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Can you tell us how will
the darkness manifest itself in January?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is a gradual
darkness, more of a group consciousness and formation of this force.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You have given us a date
for the moment, of the manifestation of the Messiah. Can you give us a date
equal for the dark force?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It begins with them
on the 16<sup>th</sup> of January.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Begins, when does it end?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Good evening.  Thank you
for being with us tonight.  Um, thank you for the information on ----’s
question about our living circumstance because that has been weighing very
heavy on my soul.  Um, and that was very helpful and I, I feel relieved and
refocused, somewhat, regarding that.  It’s been really difficult, our
situation.  We really appreciate your help and your guidance.  Um, I’d like
some information about what my mission is regarding my music and my voice so
that I may stay on the right path.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Sometimes we say good
evening.  But in retrospect, where we stand, it is morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I’ll never make that
mistake again, I promise.  Thank you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: What we’re trying to
say, it is all relative, but in the joking form.  What is your voice and what
do you do with this?  It is quit clear that you’ve trained very well and you’ve
taken the time to connect from this world to the fourth dimension.  I do not
know if you all understand this concept.  But you are now in the third
dimension.  But understand this clearly that you are going in a cyclical
pattern again.  A circle pattern of on upward.  And in the year 2011, you will
open to what we call the flat door.  The flat door or the door is just a box. 
It is a beginning to the fourth dimension.  Your Earth is beginning to revolve
into that area of space in its travel that has taken thousands and thousands of
years through the first dimension.  Then it went through the second dimension. 
And then it has gone through the third dimension.  You are about ready to enter
into the fourth dimension.  But it is touching it.  It will take another
thousand to two thousand years before you enter totally into the fourth
dimension as known.  But the box is all, is the totalness of the fourth
dimension.  But we call this box the capsule and it gives you a essence of all
that is in the fourth dimension at one moment.  So, your voice is that of
bringing and meshing the souls and preparing them for the fourth dimensional
entrance, the entrance of a fourth kind.  The fourth entrance or the entrance
of the fourth factor.  We call this the fourth x-factor.  Your voice is the job
of revealing this work and meshing the information of the beings around the
Earth, through the Earth, in the Earth and, of course, the Council hears this
of you.  Your job is clear.  To bring men and woman through this fourth
dimension and get them ready for it.  By the year 2011 it will be upon you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The whole earth is now set
for the final stage. The entity has traveled different places setting the
co-ordinates and the energy grid marks as planned exactly. We had utilized this
movements around the world to get ready for the great (anchoring). We have not
been here for quiet some time and the reason for this is the supervisory Empire
of the co-lation (co-ration?) code and exper-ne of the galaxy 489. This galaxy
is marked 489 on the grid star stellar galectical map. 489 is in existence for
many millions of years. The earth is a tripod-u-ne of existence. We have walked
with you many, many years. We have trained you and guided you over the years,
we have prepared you for this very same great years to come. It is the
tri-lateral ca-lin core kos-dis or the 3 top cornea or the eyes of the 3 or the
concave x, more or less the 3 points of convexture. The 3 arc points are
converging at this very moment. It is the greatest power of every millennium
and they are focused within its con-venture of convex. That is the 3 line
linear tri-secting and forming a what would be called the point of the star of
David. We have many different forces and fields that are going to split in the
what would be called  second sub-direction. Every force and energy of its field
has many different splitting elements which happens only on a certain point. It
is like an acorn or walnut that falls from a tree and splits open at a certain
point. We have many different elements and (concepts?) and different directions
to speak about. It will take time to explain all to everyone and not every is
all, that is there are some thoughts here that will be far beyond peoples
grasp. It sounds like and even looks like, but instinctively everyone in this
room and the rooms around have all the awareness of the presence of Ae-te-us.
Ae-te-us is that element that is ready and focused within its own course. We
have many different directions and focuses that are what we call implement of
the knowledge. Therefore the next 3 years, 3 years of classic what would be
understood as test and trials, not only to this house but to all those in this
area, that this cloud formation that is making a premature (..) is not a cloud
formation but is us in presence. You have many different safe-guards that are
all about and many have the aspect of the safe guards to direction, but
remember there are many different forms, many different ways of perceiving,
many different icons and many different symbols. You are now in its own
element. The element of knowing and sharing.</span></p>

Iron Age. And your all entering into the Magnetic Age. And soon you shall enter
into what would be considered the element, elements of the Structural Age after
the Magnetic Age you shall enter directly into the Structural Age. So each
particular season has a certain lesson and everything is moving so fast around
this particular Iron Age because of its shortness, that there is so much
development and evolution that needs to be done. That should suffice for the

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>It is one of the weakest 
points in the  human development. At this moment which is a critical stage of
mans evolution that only the most developed can succeed in this critical hour.
At this particular stage it is repeating a cycle of Egypt and leaving to the
Holy Land. There were many who had left and gone back to Egypt, because of
comfortability and status and things known of. This is a normal cycle for souls
who come on the path and stayed on it for the sake of comfortability in Egypt
and then when they do start moving, there ones of the first to justify there
own leaving and entering back into Egypt because of their lack of faith and
most of all, because the soul is not going to develop any longer and the soul
has resigned too a life of slothfulness, this retards the soul, not only in
this life, but refuses the entrance of the soul back into the earth until the
progress of those who are advanced have sustained themselves tremendously,
allowing these souls to come in as unfit society or unfit civilized people or
the lower eschelon of people in a social class many thousands of years to come.
So it is like one you refuse to take on the responsibilities of this critical
moment and two you set yourself up as restraining yourself from entering into the
earth for thousands of years to come, until the souls who are in the earth
develop to a certain point that they can be caretakers of the unfit class.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Too every question there
is an answer and there is a antidote to every sickness, it’s just that the time
factor, that we are so briefly here on the earth and the forces that are in
play are so slow in moving to our brief lifespans.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There are certain
laws and regulations during each Age of development that must be maintained.
The Age of Ke-li is about 400,000 give or take, but the Age of the Golden
Light  would go up to 17 or somewhere beyond 4,000. Each has its shortness and
darkness, the total length of light is longer than all shortness of the
darkness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You said the Age of Kali
is 400,000 years?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: What is remaining is 
470,000 years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: 470,000 years and the age
of the, and the Golden Age will last you said 17,000?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Something in that
area.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Then the Age of Kali is
more?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The 470,000 with the
170,000.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Oh I see. So the its still
more?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What about the 4,300
years?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That is at this point
the balance. The Golden Age is what would be considered put all together in its
certain denominations, breaking down is triple the times of the Age of Ke-li.
So you would have somewhere around the area of more or less a million years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And then the Dark Age
starts again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No, then you have the
Age of Gold and the Age of Silver and slowly gets smaller and smaller until the
Age of where we’re at now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And we have still 4,000 years
to go in the Age of Kali?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: 4,000 about 700 years
to go.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: 4,700?</span></p>

souls that didn’t make it after the Age of Kali?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They are kept from
the Golden Age.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But they wouldn’t like it
anyhow?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well in the Silver
Age, then they are put in under disciplines, throughout many lifetimes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Disciplines through the
infirmities of the body and?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The class system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What the most predominant
thing about the Age of Kali?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The darkness and the
greed and many being the ruler.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And how about those people
that put on and take off God like a glove?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Those are the ones
that will be left in the wings and kept from the Golden Age.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: They wouldn’t even know it
though, there soul would know it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: At the time of the
Golden Age it will be well known.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But there would be no need
for groups like ours at that point?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The group like yours
would be a mass society group.</span></p>

say. Lets say this group a hundred percent succeeds, every person here in this
group succeeds?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Then they have
fulfilled their major test was placed upon them before they came into the earth
for such a short period of time and their karmetic ties would be balanced out
under this critical moment and everything that they had lived since the
beginning of time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now will these people
then, the ones that succeed be, will be in the Golden Age on the earth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They will have
positions and power and titles, authority at that moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Then that’s all were
striving for. I mean..?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Golden Age lasts
for thousands and thousands of years and therefore a life expectancy would be
extended beyond understanding and also the power beyond that in the Higher
Sphere of the galaxies will be affected.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But if this is right now
at the age of Kali everybody is seeking worldly positions, even in this group a
big deal, worldly positions titles, it’s very important. And this is the Age of
Kali. So if this is what your going to get as a reward then why bother going
through all that they can have it right now/</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We don’t understand
you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: If the reward of the
Golden Age is to have worldly position, that means the rightous..?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Its not a worldly
position we are referring to it’s a spiritual commission from this earth to the
other galaxies beyond, that they will direct the masses, with the understanding
of the message of the Higher Forces.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And those souls that did
not make it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Will be the slaves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Will they be able to look
and know that this is..?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You would at that
time have screens to record and show past lives. At that particular Age
everyone will see his or her past lives. At that particular Age there will be
no between male and female.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Because everybody will
know that we are both?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Oneness would
come into being.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And you said also a
oneness with the rest of the Universes?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: At that particular
time there will be intergalactical communications with other galaxies in the
Universe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And that time is how far
away? 4,700 years?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: 4,000, 4, 4,700
years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How will it come into
being?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Gradually, as this
Age is gradually dispersing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So there would have to be
already signs of that new Age coming in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Its already upon you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Where are they, what are
those signs?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We’re speaking to you
aren’t we.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So that Age will actually
be declared when you come down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Physically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So actually in our
lifetime.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You are witnessing to
it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: We will be witnessing to
you coming down physically?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That we will give
you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are you referring to the
Sessions?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Not only the
Sessions, you will physically see them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And from that moment that
you land physically, that the beginning of the end of the Age of Kali?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That is the Age of
Advice or the Nirvana entering into mans consciousness, where they are saying a
new heaven. So in reality you can invest in the future because the earth will
not blow up tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I didn’t understand that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Tomorrow, there will
be a tomorrow its not going to end the earth. You have at least another 4,700
years to go, then you have another a million years after that. Kind of looks
stupid in 1979.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: No its not stupid its just
that I feel that I wish we could be a little bit more developed that we could
retain a memory so we could learn from it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, there will be
screens at every corner, every place of learning in that time, the past lives
will be reviewed openly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are there people in this
house that will be alive that Age?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: All those members who
make it through this will have positions interconnected together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But from the moment that
you come down in 2010, 2011?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That is the beginning
of the appearances. They have already started.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But that point you are
going to actually come down and stay?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Start planning and
putting it all into action.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And make it an open thing?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Age of Ke-li
actually was in its midst when Nebuchannesar was assassinated, about the year 604,
603 BC.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You said something about
the Age of Light going on for thousands and thousands of years, is that
different from the Golden Age which I thought was supposed to be a thousand
years on and a thousand years off?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Golden Age is
much more than a thousand years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Will, when you come down
in 2010, 2011, will Jesus come down or any of the others?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We have been in their
positions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Will they come down to
prove as a symbol as a proof of a case?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They will.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The Silver Age that
preceded this one, when did that end. What did that coincide with that we might
know of and what time?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Silver Age did
not precede this one, it was the Bronze Age.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And when did that end?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The Bronze Age..?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Ended when Krishna was
killed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The existence of Atlantis
coincided with which of those Ages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The existence of
Atlantis, the eruption about 10,000 BC, 11,000 BC was the beginning of the
breakage of the Bronze, but into what would be considered the breaking of the
Golden Age.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The Bronze Age, the way,
is it the primitives the way we understand it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No. The Bronze Age
was a different development and creative consciousness. Remember evolution is
not from up, evolution is from the spirit down, it is not zoology from the
lower to the higher. And that again is where man thinking what is right, is
wrong. For man was not developed as a small child does what a small child does.
We here that a child of two, three or four years old does a certain act, and we
are taught this in school, that this act is common and useful. But we forget
that the spirit within the child was of higher, now the child expresses the
lowest. You do not but work the soul as far as going up. Do not get caught into
a logical explanation of the soul coming from down to up. It is the soul that
had come from up to down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How does it go, it goes,
the Ages, the Golden Age?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We have the Golden
Age, the Silver, the Bronze and the Iron.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What would be called the
Age when man was primitive running in the jungle?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well we understand
that you were referring to the Bronze Age. This could be that Age, but also it
was principles for there were giants at that time too, that were very
developed. Man has only recorded the Age of the ape.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Oh, you mean to say before
the ape, there were human beings that, de-evolved to the ape?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: To that degree yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So actually its not that
man came from the ape, but that the ape came from man?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That’s right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And is that always the
evolutionary cycle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Man can even become
lower than what he is now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: He could?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You mean we are that low?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You’re not that high.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is that a (..) that we
live so short?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is. Man if he
tunes into the spiritual side will gradually refine himself and raise
everything up higher.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And yet the memory, how
does one deal with not being able to remember the mistakes the..?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Man does remember the
mistakes, he’s reminded when he sleeps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But then he wakes up
and..?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: He does not forget,
it’s just new things have come his way to put into activity on a conscious
level, he’s still reacting on a subconscious level.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When you mentioned the
Ages while ago, you didn’t mention the Stone Age, is that not part of the Ages?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Stone Age can be
inserted into that of the Bronze Age.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is it correct that it
preempted the Bronze Age until the putting together of copper and tin was sent
down as a (&gt;&gt;) thought form into the earth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We are not referring
to the Ages as far as the materials on the earth, but as far as the spiritual
evolution within the soul of man in the body. Its true what you do say the
Stone Age preempts the, but as far as the spiritual evaluation the strongest
points, it goes through the evolution with man, being a Golden and the Silver
and the Bronze and the Iron, and it could be variable, variance here and there,
and later on in another session, we will go over it with you again and give you
to some of the facts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is the royal family of
England destined to be assassinated, would that be the hallmark of the middle
of this Age.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The royal family of
England you said something dealing with their assassination marked the midpoint
of this Age, or the point of 4,700 years. Are they now destined to be assassinated?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Not necessarily.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was that book that was
written 3 weeks before the assassination..?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Interesting isn’t it.
They took the plan from the book.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In the fact that he said
about 2 weeks ago, that the two ways he didn’t want to die was at sea and in a
fire. Was that just karma and he just knew, like knew it was coming forth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Somehow I felt so bad when
I heard that that had happened.</span></p>

western hemisphere a lot.</span></p>

their method of calculation for events in the cosmos or whatever they have the
ending of the Age of Kali not to happen for about 130,000 years, at which time the
Golden Age takes over. Is that Golden Age and concept different than what we
know of as the Golden Age, is it a whole different time cycle?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: What did we say you
were going to have at the Golden Age.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Another 4,700 years its
going to start.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Did we say 4,000. But
they said a 100,000.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: According to their record
I believe it’s a 137,000 something like that years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Its 4,700 and some
odd years from now the beginning of the Golden Age, cycle they are only asking,
they are referring to the height of the Golden Age at that point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell us please
what will be the social structure in the Golden Age?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Will be communities
living and vibrating together, each one having a High Teacher and a spiritual
Guide, an insightful person with the sights of foreknowledge and each one of
these High Masters will have under them, jurisdiction of seven to eight
instructors. The instructors in return shall give the plan and the system to
the leaders, the leaders will have what would be considered the learners, the
learners will give then to the followers. All the way down to the system, each
one having a particular job and structure to work on. This would make the
community or city or town cooperative with energy coming from the sun and with
a great deal of creative ability surrounding that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So this is like cities
that will remain cities and villages and countries?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There shall be no
more villages or countries because everything shall be developed to the
minutest degree.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So in reality the commune
idea will continue and take its full course in the Golden Age?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is correct, the
communal living will have its structure and tell each section to have its area
of influence, be it every five miles or every 15 miles there will be a major
community and then there will be a major council within the district and you
will have a district council that will meet and the district councils, then you
have what would be considered, the Guides or Guiders. The Guiders will be what
would be considered what you would have..answer to the Elect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And will there be, who are
the Elect, are there energy people?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Elect are those
who from past lifetimes have created and developed their lives to take on the
mission. There shall be for each procleration council there shall be two Elects
for each Council. Designated not by political means, but by past lives and
amount of work operating to get to a point for the Elect in which they will
hold a job for a period of 10 to 15 years, following suite and reviewed every 6
to 7 months to see how they are applying the spiritual principles and as such
they will have direct communication with the being from the other galaxy and
the information to develop and grow a society as know from the Elect they would
receive these laws and regulations to provide proper council from on down to
the followers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Will there be also a world
governing body?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There shall be a
Council of Elects that would be considered the hierarchies of the earth and each
one would meet as a unified force for the councils of the Elects.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But that’s not yet the
moment when they will reach the ability of movement in and out of the physical
body?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This too will be a
growing process and will be developed as time in that particular evolution
accomplishes itself. (..) will be a great deal of astral traveling done with
this (&gt;&gt;) and messages instead of telephone could be relayed psychically
from one to the other by concentrating and focusing the mind on the person.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Will they have, what kind
of transportation will they have?</span></p>

planes and solar trains and solar ships.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But its not yet the moment
where they can become total matter, where they can just put on a body at will
like Jesus did after the resurrection.</span></p>

said would not be able to reincarnate back into the earth during the Golden
Age, will all of them be in Saturn or where will they be?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Some will be on the
moons of Saturn and of  Jupiter and certain other moons. The Golden Age will be
1,729,000 years. Kind of short.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In you’re re-counting how
many years does that make in the cosmos or in the Universe. How many years does
that count for?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: In our years, about 4
to 5 days. Traveling time. Everything is relative now isn’t it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: At this point we are
trying to explain the different evolutions of man, through the Golden Age
1,729-26,000 years to the Silver Age 1,296,000 years through your Bronze Age
320 some odd thousand years to your Iron Age 480 to 32,000 years. (?432,000)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That’s your present
Age now, 470,400 and, about 470,000 with the calculation, give or take a few
thousand years. It is interesting that this we are speaking about of Ages and
that the development through each Age of a spiritual purpose and pattern and
physical purpose and pattern.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: If to you a 1,729,000 is 4
days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, that you could
double to 8 days, give or take some days here and there for traveling time of
course.</span></p>

the metal of the outside of the ship as being of two thin layers of silvery
material. Between these two layers is a vacuum which is used to lift the ship.
The faster this vacuum spins around inside these two layers (in a spiral) the
faster the ship will travel. He also described the light inside the ship as
traveling in a gyro rotation. Speed of outside of ship vibrates at a certain
speed that allows space inside to be controlled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>It is through your own faith
that you see us. It is your doubts that dispel us from being seen. Our ships
are nothing greater than those that you can see on an earthly level. But we
have one thing remarkable. Inside the ship is what we call a pulsating light,
ultra violet more also. In it is our food substance in which we receive our
energy. It is a cellamic force field in which we sit down. In it we receive our
sustenance, our food, our water, our sustenance on a spiritual and soul growth
level. This movie that is from the French people or from France is similar in
one degree or another, closely near to what would be near to what we do. It is
a force of meditation that we enter into. But remember it is even greater than
that. It is our whole rejuvenation of our soul level or electrical field that
will be revealed. In the spaceship we have many corridors. Each corridor is lit
by  beams of light that bounce off and pulsate back and forth to the center of
the galley which is called the forehand. The forehand is where the four major
people or the four major parties sit and relay their thoughts to the Mother
ship. And the Mother ship, in turn which consist of a great vast city inside it
self relays their thought forms and gives them into the galaxy or what would be
called the satellite Mother-ship. The satellite Mother-ship conveys that to
what would be called the Galactic&#8209;Mother-ship. The Galactic&#8209;Mother-ship
is what would be called that of the planetoloid or what would be called
satellites in which it will relay back to our own planet that we came from. But
remember, the satellite, or the galactic, or the planetory ship, all these are
indescribable states in which we operate through. The walls are constantly
cleansed by what you would call water. It is not a water substance that is
cleansed, but it is cleansed by an oily substance or what would be called
molecule changing. The substance changes with color. As we cross the speed of
light this substance turns a bright red. As we approach the speed of sound, it
changes to a bright blue. Each substance changes the appearance of our vehicle
in which we materialize and de&#8209;materialize into other dimensions faster.
We Have enough space upon this ship that we travel in for 400 people to reside
in. Not what would be called the Ark, to have all the cattle and sheep’s and
oxen in a specific area to place them and protect them. This is a small ship
that can handle 400 people. The Mother&#8209;ship of course the first, or the
first Mother&#8209;ship can handle 8 ½ million people or approx. the population
of N. Y. City which is nothing for there is a big enough room for more could be
handled. For this is the space, for the space in your dimension is completely
different from ours. Therefore when you enter into our ships, your molecules
change almost immediately as you enter a different force-field. Remember the
pictures that are coming through to this entity are actual Deities, are actual
force&#8209;fields, are actual beings that do reside and exist in our planet.
The antenna&#8209;like substance upon their heads are the centers that are
above the bodies manifested on a physical level, picking up and sending psychic
vibrations from false substance or black forces around them. As this entity did
say this living room resembles partially what would be called one of our
vehicles or forehands or galleys, in which the four members do reside and
discuss and plan movements and positions. It is one particular thing that would
be missing, what to you would be called the glass globe is what we have. The
glass globe is what would be called the crystal eye or the eye of the (bye),
that is the eye or that of the ball, which would be centered in the middle of
the table to describe and give thought and force or what would be called
picturistic idea of what we are in or operating in. The color for the chairs
are adequate, for that’s exactly the same colors we do have in our chair
covering. Brown is a suitable color for logical and line drawings that are
needed for substance and for inner-thought. Also we have rooms in which are
what would be called pictures or photographs or what would be called the
librarian. This here takes constantly. It what would be called taps into every
major city in the world that is politically or what we call financially in
destiny of you globe, the earth. This is being constantly surveyed. Also, you
might be relevant excited to understand that such of these rooms that we talk
about, long and narrow and has what would be called a large table, represents
the rooms that we speak through to meet and talk with you. These are what would
be called the galley or the meeting room, even though they represent the same
galley&#8209;force&#8209;field in which the four members do reside. This galley
or meeting room is where we communicate with you deities or beings of the
earth. So, you can see what great powers you do reside or have because only
those who are important in government, financial, or spirit happenings in the
earth are really in communication with us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The Movie Close Encounters
when they went inside the ship, is that anything like your ships look like
inside?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Ah! We do better than
that. What was it that we had told you many, many sessions ago, what one of the
major ships were.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: 18 football fields.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You see that our ship
is bigger. I just came over a dumb dome, would make the whole area go dark, and
they would have to move their silly little airstrip so we could at least put
our door down. Inside of our ships, well, hold on a minute, alright, course
this tape here is not to be revealed to the public, so you’ll consider this
your information. If you ever type up this sessions or any session where we,
there are some things that you don’t type up, completely reserve that. The
information to be reserved from this point until we inform you so starting now.
Ah! One of the ships that we have we call the Zionite Zidek or Zionite ship.
The Zionite ship is designed to infiltrate and intercept communications between
major governments of your earth. A Zionite ship is at least comparatively a
smaller ship in our fleet. It is a silver out exterior more of a ignite
aluminum type basis that you would know. It is in its flat stage(projective
geometry) about what would be considered 45 ft high to 69 ft wide. Ah. This
usually occupies one robot ah or one pilot to two pilots. It is a scanning type
device ah has on it ah 400 laser so called beams that you know and 777 what
would be called instruments of analyzation and detection and fingerlike
substances of experiment design. Has 3 layers in it of space to contain these
experimental items. Steps generally do not go up on a straight angle, they have
a curved step ladder where we spiral on up in and around the walls of the ship.
The steps do not go through the center of the ship that is completely domed or
shaped like and the force field goes through the center of the ship to give its
momentum. It is compressed to a point of 50ft high and 144 ft wide that is at
the maximum expansion. Ships do expand to almost double their size(?Auk) to
disappear or appear and ah reappear. This Zionite ship can submerge into 6
fathoms of water Or  16 fathoms, the deepest. And the course of these ships are
guided by the Mother Ship rather than direct control, for the Mother Ship
receives its information by the many scopic, telescopic and microscopic mirrors
that line the ship to give vision and distance in space and sending it back to
the Mother Ship. What it is meaning there are the pilots that supervise
internal actions, but the distance and traveling of the ship is sub-supervised
by the Mother Ship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>You have a Father&#8209;Ship
we call it the Si&#8209;gar Ship or you call it the cigar ship. It is in the
form of a cigar. This is used to carry experimental creatures and when we say
experimental creatures we mean a force of do&#8209;gooders. They come in and
infiltrate into the earth and change certain things around. A cigar ship can
run anywhere from 144ft long to 200ft. The height is anywhere from 45 to 59 ft,
anywhere to 75ft high. And they are air conditioned. They have a storage place
of containing records and data and they are generally the library, library and
the data fleet&#8209;ship. When they would accumulate records and data for all planets
throughout the Universe. And we usually say if you want a bit of information go
puff on the cigar. Then we have the fleet one ships, which are the major ships
that are sited throughout the earth. This is equipped with major devices,
scanners of systems, experimentation’s of device to be used operational and
cervical, surgical and laboratory experimentation on different cultures to be
inserted. They could come anywhere with a fleet of 200 to 3,000 people to
operate and to reuse run them. These ships have a capacity of traveling 5 times
the speed of light, along with to the 10th power. They have pure glass, but not
as you know where you could see entirely out of the ship from any part where
you stand inside. And they can supply several living centers, each center could
supply anywhere from 200 to 470 individuals in them. They are known relatively
to be safe and sound proof from exterior noises, but do have a tendency of mis&#8209;marking
or missing the marks. Of course we have other major and minor ships. We have
the float along ship, that floats along, floats along the clouds and floats
along the water&#8209;front and the mountain areas. This usually consists of 7
people, light bubble shape, anywhere from 7ft high to 22ft high and the length
could be anywhere from 18ft long to 57ft long. And they simply just float along
and observe and watch. Their know as the <i>scanning </i>ships in one respect.
That should do it for the moment end of information that needed to be kept.</span></p>

how do they come down and can they be recognized?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They come down on

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Let me point out a little
thing that you have overlooked. That within our space vehicle, in the center of
it, we have what is called a gyro. That is the balancing of or bringing into
that of the 3rd and 4th dimension that we are guided with. And we can guide in
and out at any time. This gyro when it works properly, for we, too, have many
troubles with it that projects us billions of years ahead of ourselves. But
when the gyro is working, it transfigures and makes balance everything around
it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Heard in a session.
Rotations of the ring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This represents the
movement of what would be considered the physical body and the spirit within
the physical body making evolutions within the physical body to become more
aware and enlightened of the spirit. It also represents the space vehicle or
ships flying through space and time moving forward and backwards in order to
fulfill the ship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Does it have anything to
do with the Ring Pass Not?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This ring is an
explicit sphere of barrier manecular, manicular, maniculae, molecule
force-field that is generally the same concept in which the solar system is
moving through space. Our ships are just a rendition of the solar force&#8209;field
copied through space, for if we are to move through space, we must move as
space moves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: T. talked to us once about
how the ships ran and said they had very small holes and there was unequal
pressure between the inside and the outside and he drew a diagram of it showing
different lines of, I guess pipes and air-holes. Could you explain how that
works?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It works more on the pressure
of steam with your radiators. When you hear it knocking you know the steam is
coming up. In such there’s pressure forcing heat. It is not the steam and the
heat it is the after effect of heat raising in the air. The same is the same in
our spaceship. It is that steam heat that affects the outside of the air that
is controlled by the inner walls that raises the ship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is Tiphereth associated

understand the part of the middle ear that spirals around, what that would
represent in a ship?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is a balancing
polarity. It is also the fact in which in the middle ear is stored up certain
locked keys between this dimension and the dimension that you go to on the
other side. It is called the doorway between the ? (Physical) visible and the
invisible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How does the door open?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Sometimes this

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In the case of possession,
knowing that almost everybody every day becomes possessed at certain times and in
going to the extreme of, this case of possession that we saw in the movie and
knowing how easy it is on a day to day level to have those moments where you
become possessed. What has to happen for a case like we saw in that movie to
happen, where that so total of possession takes over a person?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Interesting as it is,
possession is also a two way street, while one might be reacting, you must
remember that there is a reaction to, ah reactor around it. Ah the conditions
of possession taking about in the body is gradual. More or less the, the
expression of, of destruction and the how could we say it, this total hate and
lashing out at all those around is a force that the society and the pressures
in society has created a work tool with Satan. A large percentages of jobs are
in Satan’s territories, there are very few jobs in respect that Satan does not
walk occasionally into. What we are trying to say is that possession is a
quality in which Satan enters within the body, it happens, and it happened to Jesus,
where he was being tempted many times, it had to go through that trial and test
and tribulation, many times to succeed and many times to fail, but always to
try it over again. This aspect of Satan works basically in a physical level and
worldly level first, of the logical mind. And it uses the logical mind so
expertly, that is it categorizes and puts items into topics and subjects and
outcomes. Not allowing the spirit at all to take over their lives, their
allowing pure logic and not faith to take over their lives, therefore the
spirit has a difficult time of entering and you would have the conflict there
of the outburst or the war with the spirit versus the logical mind. The logical
mind of course is Satan’s tool of using this instrument on a worldly level.
There are many creative and outpouring efforts that could be done on a worldly
level, but there are so many blocks and gates that it cannot really become
expressive and stops the flow of that energy, but the unblocking of it or the
working this out quality is very dramatically through the prayers, through the
chanting’s of your songs and through your meditations has a tremendous power of
uplifting gradually from that mire and putting you on a plateau that elevates
you. Many of you wonder of, try to wonder of, what happens in meditation and
prayer. It is a stepping stone from this logical mind arena and it does truly,
without you knowing it elevates the consciousness and gives you inspiration on
many levels. Today there are, are very few majority, a very few, receive
inspiration and rejuvenation, because very few of them enter into meditation,
they stay on a sub-link level of prayer and never enter into that state of, of
the Rays, give it whatever name you want. How to ah prevent possession on every
day level, daily level occurrence’s, of prayer of course and meditation and
keeping a ah, of the seal that you have of course helps tremendously over your
Heart center. For possession enters into the Heart. If you look at it you have
the 4 beasts, you have the ox and the bull and the lion and the eagle and the
man. Now the bull of course you all know represents Taurus and of course as the
question was asked about Moses and the blessings and. In that time it was the
Taurean Age, takes about 2,000, 2120 or 2,240 years for the sun to go through
the Zodiac  Signs. And when the sun  equinox follows a particular Zodiac Sign,
it enters that evolution and experiences that development that is going on in
the earth. Of course at that time Taurus represented the Bull in which the
people worshiped the Bull and placed the Sun Orb around its horns. Of course
the Bull is a tremendous brute force that becomes base and destructive in its
path and has that power of destroying all that it meets or understands, so the
understanding power, becomes, if those qualities in you do not understand, well
rather than to persevere in work, you destroy, so this would represent the
Bullishness in us. The positive side of the Bull is perseverance, working, and
the stick-to-it-iveness that the Bull represents, in order to give the
Hierophant the raising of the powers. Of course you are now in the Aquarian Age
which represents the mysticism and psychic and sciences and revelations, and
would represent ah 3 stages of Aquarius, that of Saturn and that of Mercury and
of course that of Venus, the 3 stages of, of your ah science in Aquarius. Of
course these are triads and there are 3 degrees in themselves. So in these
degrees you have 15 ah total, 15 degrees and 15 and 15. But the 3 degrees would
represent that power in which once again the sounds on the earth need to
evolve, instead of being just the base man in that of Saturn, understanding
that in this age you are entering all the religious occults happening. That is
there are many groups forming, many systems. You are not to segregate yourself
from one system versus another. You are a group yes, a learning experience
course, and in these experiences of spiritual laws you must be open to receive
and understand the other. And this is important, of course you had entered into
a group that you were invited to and we would suggest to be a little bit more
sharing of the tenets of your beliefs, little bit more expressive in your
creative energies. Of course it was kind of careful and all things considering
it was advantageous to be carefully expressive, but your tenets and your
beliefs, we are not asking that you go out and sow, simply just be them and
live them and the groups that you will meet, divisive and decisive as they are,
that level would be reached with each particular group met. And perseverance
and patience and cooperation is needed with each group that you meet. They will
not meet up with the standards that you have been living with, nor on the other
hand, that other particular group feels that their standards are a bit
different from yours. So this needs a certain amount of patience ah knowing
that each group has something to offer, but not to subdue and dominate totally
anything that you do meet. But this is what is going on at this moment, a certain
segments of groups are developing into nucleus and the stronger ones and the 
more apt to survive and the more able to maintain themselves become polished
and become more resonance and sound carriers and refined and they are the
instruments for the future days to come as the thruttle, throne bearers or the
establishers of the four corners. And of course this is what you are all
working at and on to become a center in which you will be used to become the
establishers of the Law, as difficult as it might seem to be, the Law in itself
is not accepted readily, it must be proven by example and actions. Now you
might be wondering how we got on this tangent from possession to the Aquarian
Age, simply that we love to talk, but what we are expressing here is that possession
comes in and goes through a different areas of cycles and we are mentioning the
seal that you wear and the crest and in so doing we express the different
avenues of the Ages of the 4 beasts that needs to be developed within man,
which ties us into the present conversation that we are now following. But of
course man must soar from his desires into the Eagle, the Eagle Man, where he
becomes the inspiration and of course that would move you into Venus, that
would be of the Aquarian section, never has it been before that man in this
time of Age had moved from the base quality of Saturn, of all his precepts and
principles into that of Mercury. Now through your prayers and chants,
meditations, it will give you the energy and inspiration to move into the Signs
of Mercury. And this will give you more what would be called inspirational
inventions, which this particular aspect of Aquarius would represent. Very few
then would go into Venus which would be the Love aspect of the Aquarian Age,
that of the Christ Spirit coming in. So you have a great potential set ahead
and before you to accomplish. Everyday must be met and before you know it,
you’ll be in your 60’s and 70’s some of you and your life will be in back of
you, but your ground work still must be done and each day becomes the biggest
advantage and test in this cycle of development of the beast within, which ties
us to the possession, cause when the beast within gets more dominance and more
control then they refuse to relinquish anything. That’s where patience and
perseverance and faith and love and compassion comes in, in subduing the beast
within man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now the Aquarian Age, what
will be the symbol for the Aquarians?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Aquarian Age is
the Angel-Man and is symbolized as the Angelic Being.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you explain what is
the nature of what we call the ships and how they start off in the 8th
dimension and how would they travel a system which is in the locks. The process
by which they start off and travel through this?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Ships are the
inability and ability to project and reappear into dimensions. Ships are
another force of angelic beings which is the hierarchies or angelic host. Host
are angelic ships. Host being ships ah many visions of angels had been flying
in spaceships or host. Another name for spaceships is host. Host of many
natures could imply many things, but a host is that which the elements of a
civilization, society, or dimension is given food or given sustenance or is
taking its food from. This is what you would call host and this is what the
meaning of the name. Ah a host is also a private ah culture and environment.
The angelic host comes from the angel word and An&#8209;letic office, angelic
or quality of possessing the host state and manifesting it on the earth. There
are many changes in this state. But there are also many fundamental laws that
imply the building of a dome type condition. Where the host or a spaceship do
travel they only go through the time warp sequence to the conditions that they
are needed. No host or ship ever is found in areas that they are not needed or
implementation or inclination of their substance. All ships are found in areas
that they can handle. Therefore the ships are operated by a energy of the sun
but not of this same ?(sword) stored and manufactured away. It is more also
handled by a crystal type effect of inner reflection and energy that can last
oh for a period of 4 to 40 years. Ships are very deviation and different type
of conditions and locks, ah it can affect the physical body, mental body, and
spiritual body. Ah these ships hovering above affect the atmosphere and
environment of the area. This should take care of you as far as ships are
concerned. Flying saucers or ships can go in devious manners and appear and
reappear. They warp zone effect. But the laws are still the laws and they are
still be obeyed by the laws.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now are there regular
ships that do not change, something like the earth maybe or more sophisticated?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is what you call
the Grand Ship or the Grand Prix type understanding or the novel, novelty
foundation in which the air inside of them wears to a level in which they need
to be replaced.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But normally the other
ships, is there, is the whole ship sort of affected by a particular mood or
vibration of the occupants within?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This could be true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And do they as they move
ah lets say they come from the 8th dimension, then as they come down into the
3rd dimension will they the 7 dimension’s their consciousness be a little bit
less, and then a little bit less until the 3rd dimension. Do they go through
these changes?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: These certain lock
systems, yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is there any way to, for
the 8th dimension to reach...?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Unravel into the 3rd
dimension.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Yes. This is the meditation
process of calling upon the over-self to come down and take possession.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But other than that is no
being that can come from the 8th dimension into the 3rd dimension without
change?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is not true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So they can?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well they can but
they have to have some agreement or written clarification on that they are
about to do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: From whom to whom?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: From that which is in

relationship the host we consecrate as set up by Jesus, how it relates to this?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The host is a direct
relationship of the flying saucer vehicle and represents to the higher self the
return symbol of the soul.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You were describing the
ships and you said that they were made of angelic host and yet when they I
guess so to speak descend through the dimensions or go through dimensions they
finely end up in the 3rd dimension appearing to us as like a metal type of
object. What is it like when you start off in the 8th dimension for you or do
you actually enter into some type of a vessel or you just project yourselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Lets say the 8th
dimension is like a flame burning constant glow and more of a radiation of
heat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But is it something that
you actually enter into?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Oh yah,   its

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is there anything…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Well the prayers that you say
is your conscious work of going to and focusing on the harmony of the words,
and this will put you into the right runway in which you can takeoff. All you
are talking about is very simple, You are all little airplanes, read, to fly.
Now you can be earthbound: end caught in the earth, or you can soar, at its
highest point. Its up to you to decide whether you want to leave your hanger,
or you don't want to leave your hanger, and all we are trying to say it is not
so difficult to leave the comfortability of the hanger, and reeve your motors
up and get ready to takeoff, of course that is what we are here for is to help
you levitate and takeoff.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I feel like when I read
some secret books, I get help from that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Of course but, these
are the beginnings. These are the &quot;revving&quot; of your wings, of your
motors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: …and it helps me do it. ­</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What you are saying is
that D. is looking for a gidget that he can buy in the store to help him
physically. Something that he can hold onto, and that will never lift him up
out of the hanger, and....</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: NO no, no, no, you
can't be lifted up out of the hanger. You must move out from the hanger, you
must move out from the hanger into the runway, and the moving, the airplane
from the hanger to the runway always takes help, takes a little little car that
moves the airplane from the hanger onto the runway, or takes some guidance of
the control tower, or takes, and that force to guide you, and that's what the
BIBLE is....is control tower to give you permission to takeoff, to guide you
through the laws of the earth and get you on the runway, so you can soar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The thing that I was
working on, what was that then?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>That lights up your runway,
it will not lift you, but it will guide you down the runway. What will lift you
is the momentum and the force and the speed, that you build up of faith in the
spiritual laws&quot; and as you believe in the faith you turn your, you turn
your motor. Faith is the engine that turns the jets or the propulsion, and when
you have enough faith, and enough speed, you combat the law of gravity. Isn't
that wonderful'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The thing again. This
thing I am working on, Is it just another gidget or gadget or is it, I mean I
really don't know what it is, you have been revealing it to me......</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: (It is more)of
lights, dimensions, time span, that you are working with.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you show me where I
think of this thing as</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>building a ship on another
level. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is going to be
correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Two sessions ago (from
this session 334) you explained to D.that a plane when it takes off it needs to
get out of the hanger, then from the hanger to be taxied to the runway. How
does the spaceship in the 8th dimension take off?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The spaceship takes
off from a pulsation force of accumulation of light waves of love and spirit of
condensation of that energy into a point of a needle, in which at that point it
disappears from the 8th dimension and travels through the slots of the 7th.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: On the 8th dimension you
talked about before in another session how ships ( ? ) the host, I was thinking
that when it comes down to this level and appears metallic, does that mean all
elements on this level on the 8th dimension since there are 144 perfect
elements, that means they’re host on the 8th dimension, they’re like host.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well let us say yeah,
yes they’re, they have the Deity&#8209;ship ( ? ).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you help me
understand the 144 spiritual elements talked about a long time ago and how they
appear in this dimension as related to the higher dimensions?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well they appear in
the genetic structure as far as your DNA structure, that is one part of the
144,000. DNA structure is not completely finished for there are 3 offshoots
that will be found to explain the missing genetic structure of diseases. There
is a 2 bead bolus on the northeast side of one directly south of it and a third
one that shoots from the south one to the right. These are the 3 extra
findings, sections where to look to find another type of hereditary or
intelligent beings that is in man, that will soon develop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What is it that resides in
the DNA molecule?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The spirit resides in
the DNA molecule.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The complete universe without
the blessing of God?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you please tell me
about platelets, what their signification is on a spiritual level and why
lately it seems like I’ve been getting all sorts of information about them or
people have been talking to me about them?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Platelets are the
backbone of the blood cell and it is in this that the blood has its strength
and energy. They are to find that also the nucleus is not Just the electrons
and protons, the nucleus of the aQ: but their is within the nucleus the center
of aQ: that scientists will discover is the true soul of the DNA structure. And
it is in this that will unleash a great deal of knowledge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The substance that is
within the nucleus of a cell, is it the same of which the soul is made?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Scientists will begin
to understand that the nucleus is not the nucleus of a cell that their is a new
center in the cell, their just too stupid to find it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The center within a cell
is that the same as the Ring Pass Me Not?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, you could compare
it to such, yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The center within the cell
that is obviously not the nucleus, is it associated with one of the things that
has a name in scientific terms, is it the Mitochrondia?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, I N 11 let it be
it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Do the 22 letters go along
with the a, like I was reading about, the 22 amino acids? Does it correspond to
that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, of course.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So in the beginning of
Genesis that’ what there talking about?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Among other things,
they are also talking about this factor too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What does the center, the
nucleic acid represent in the center of the cell?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This represents the
soul essence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Does it represent the
higher, like the high letters?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Of course it
represents this pattern or plane. If you take one of those elements, centers
out you would have the whole structure for another body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So this is when it says in
the Bible not to tamper with that, the Laws, not to profane the ah central
point? You should never tamper with the cells in the body?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Of course. Well, it
can get out of hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Session ?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: If I knew the
correspondences between the 22 letters and the 22 amino acids would you help me
to understand cures and causes of disease?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: In time, remember to
identify these, these different cases start with the lowest percentage of
sodium and nitrogen(and or in) the chemical which will start you at the base
and work you up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Working through the
alphabet starting with aleph?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: There is another question
I have about the amino acids and the Hebrew Letters. I haven’t been able to
line them up, I did what you said, tried to do what you said, not that I
understand but could you give me any letters to go with any of the amino acids
that I could start (or) any other hints?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Gimel is the first
letter from there Nun, from there (Seth)?(Cheth) from there Aleph, from there
the Hi ?(He) of a different form not to eat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So these go along with the
Alanine on down the line like that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What does &quot;Eat my
body and drink my blood&quot; mean? And what was really happening?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is  the
transmutation from the fourth dimension to the third dimension. Transposing and
Gives rise that of bringing up, raising up the cells in your body to that of
his cells.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is there or were there
such a thing as Genies in bottles or out of them?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There are still
Genies in bottles, what do you think I am. All you have to do is rub the right
place. Our ship mechanisms operate on such a system. Genies in bottles
represent those what would be called the genetical side or the (gene&#8209;y&#8209;side)
which was their original names when they came to earth. All those who did see
them in India thought they were Genies in bottles. In fact they came from a
ship or space craft that was made out of pure cylindical glass substance.
Raising from them the power and vapors which produced them and projected them
from the space&#8209;craft. Very important information I give you. People at
that particular time asked &quot;Who art thou&quot;? and they &quot;We are
Genies&quot;, which was the name that they were originally specified or their
species were named &quot;Genie Afeytus&quot;, or&quot; the One named Genie, or
the &quot;genes of the One&quot;, or &quot;the cells of One&quot;, or &quot;the
Cells of the Elo&quot;, or &quot;the Cells of One.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In a dream that I had I
was told that if one knew the secret code of the DNA structure one could use
that and call back the body after it had died, and the Egyptians were trying to
do it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What are the Holy Living
Creatures?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Similar to what you
are. Creatures are related to man’s consciousness so that he might relate to
what these creatures are. They are not meant to be that creature.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What are these forces that
take on that aspect within man?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Expression of the
energy field around the universe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: We assume that an angel
has wings because of the motion makes it look like a wings, because of the
movement right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now when people see other
religious figures, like Jesus or Mary, how come we don’t perceive wings on
them. Does it mean that they are stationary at the time?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Some do not see it
because they do not exist. The angel world vibrates at a different rate than
the etheric vibrations of saints and of figures. The angelic world vibrates at
a higher density, creating its wings form motion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the angels force at
this point is still higher than the religious figures?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is coming from a
different dimension. The archangels or angels are not higher in scales or
relative scales. They are a different vibration of internal peace that is knowing
the things that one needs. The angels if you look at on to them, they will give
you all the answers that you need.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So which dimension are the
angels coming from and which dimension are the religious figures coming from?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Both can come through
the 3rd dimension. Some of the angels operate through the 4th and a-lot more
operate through the 5th, 4th, and 10th .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And the religious figures?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: These operate through
the earth’s vibration, the earth forces.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the 3rd dimension?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Second dimension it
is created, the 3rd dimension it takes form in body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I thought second dimension
is reserved usually for lower forms ?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The body is first
created by the lowest forms. And then after its first cells of creation, then
it is created higher into the 3rd dimension. But in all reality the body
physical, mental, spiritual is created in thought forms first and then works
itself on up through the first, acquiring its physical body in the second and
manifesting in the 3rd.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And what’s the first
dimension?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Ann. First dimension is the
force of (Auk), force of velocity, or the force of Breath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the saints come from a
lower vibration than the angels?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They are of a
different force field vibration. Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>At this moment the soul
advances into the future, at that it ends into the fourth dimension where it
has four sides, as would be known in casting it (its) moments into this
dimension. At then when the soul is transiting, it should remember that one
that it loves, that that one might be near to guide and direct it into the
light. Therefore we advise at this moment on that lesson of the fourth
dimension, that which is called death, and all those who do or become to that
level of transition remember what it is to think of that one that you do love.
At this moment there are 24 cellular structures or what would be termed as
sunbeams, involving into your physical body as leaving behind. At this time
your spirit rises above into the ithical wave lengths of the earth which passes
to the astral form into that dimension that the astral form during sleep cannot
enter. At this moment, if you are in the proper attunement, you can immediately
go into the Hall of Records.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In the lesson number one
when you spoke of the transcestorium, could you explain the use of the 24 rays
of the sun when the astral body is leaving?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Each one is the
nervous center or that which is of the nerve ending, components of the higher
sphere entering into the nerve or the cellular structure of the nervous system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So there are 24 centers
of...?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: What would be known
as chakras on one level, as what would be homes, or seven homes. 24 on other
levels which are the branches of these homes. Districts, towns cities,
countries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you explain abut the
10 Sephiroth, how they affect the spiritual centers. It’s been stated elsewhere
that there are 12 spiritual centers and yet there’s only 10?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: As what we were
giving you, there are the seven in the body, there are the three that hovers above,
which makes up the ten that should be completed in this dimension, during this
lifetime. When the spirit enters into the other dimension, and goes into other
lessons, they are carrying with them twelve centers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: On the 10 commandments,
are there 5 that are specifically geared to the left center of the brain and 5
to the right center?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is correct, the
first 5 is the right center and the last 5 is the left center.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are the 10 commandments
related in any way to the seven centers?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Ten Commandments are
related to the seven centers plus the other three centers that hover above the
body. Also they are related to the laws of your God within you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When the Resurrection took
place, did actually the soul that was Jesus take all the(?) , at one(?)?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Accurate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You said 24 chakras as the
24 rays of light that come into our body when we depart. Do you mean that on
another level we have 24 spiritual centers instead of seven?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Ten.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So what are the 24 chakras
and ?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: 24 is on a different
vibration and also on the spirit level.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So when we evolve to that
vibration then we do receive 24 spiritual centers?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Accurate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So that’s the rays of
light, right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Call it whatever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You said before the seven
centers, but in the...in some other parts of the Holy Scriptures, they talk
about the ten. The three, the seven of the earth and three higher...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: ...of the higher
sphere?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Yea. The ten Sephiroth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That is the
representation of the soul communing with the higher soul which by these three
forces one can commune with other galaxies. For we have the over-self that is
of the higher one. Within the over-self there is two more higher centers that
need to be and have been communing with that which is their guide center.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So it's like the top of
the evolution?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What is the Burning Bush?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is those
elements or centers within that have allied, allied themselves in corresponding
to the 3 higher centers. When properly in alignment they explode into a light
that represent a burning bush.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you explain how the
cross is the symbol of the heart and connecting with the two higher centers?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The cross represents
the giving up of that which is ours and offering up that which is our life for
that which is of a higher nature.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you give us the
symbolism of the star and cross together? And also the effect that it produces
on the body when worn?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The star and cross
together represents the evolution of mankind into a new consciousness. The
effect on the body is to join the three centers above the head down and the
seven centers within the body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The three centers above
are the cross?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When Jesus tells the
apostles, that don’t worry, I’m leaving but I’m going to send another comforter
to you, and He is referring to the Holy Spirit, does that mean that the Holy
Spirit wasn’t around before Jesus?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The centers within
the body were not able to hold on to the Flame of Love, which opens up the
centers for wisdom and Christ represents that Love. When He opens that Flame
over the Heart, then the Wisdom in the thyroid(?Holy Spirit)can open and make
that able to see, speak, and hear, and perceive other things beyond.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you explain to me
what exactly the Holy Spirit is?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Holy Spirit is a
force of energy uniting the ten centers of the body to light. To understand the
Godhead within you. Holy Spirit is the intuitive powers of the energies that
are beamed down to you. They form the shape of a dove, that is known as a bird,
but it is an energy force that forms this tongue. It is the three centers that
hover above the body. When the entity is in control and communicates with these
centers, the Holy Spirit abides on him and in him.</span></p>

the Holy Comforter that came to the Apostles?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That was what would
be considered the Councilor, the Paraclette, the (Guidance?) or the Servants of
Many. They had come in as the Light of Flame, illuminating them. They were
entities, than came from the Galaxies to be the Guardians. It cannot be said
any less than that. The Illuminators they are called.</span></p>

Le Corbusier made it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It could be different
by the angle of 90 degrees and in it&quot;s own circumference 160 degrees with
a right angle to the right of 41/2 degrees. This and all this given to the cube
would be the perfect symbol.</span></p>

part with a right angle to the right of 41/2 degrees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: 41/2 degrees is
always to the right of the third number; third number is three to the right of
the 33 mark, accessible by the point RA radius which is at the center accent
more so injection of the radius, which is T1 or T2, which is equal to the QR
and the ST leverage over that of the minus T.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What is the next step?</span></p>

discovered, how come nobody has looked for them when everybody is aware of them?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Because of the
spiritual law that first made the natural law. Nothing on earth can be
accomplished unless it is connected with the laws above.</span></p>

the thought of man, being capsulized in the abominations of the earth and it
showed how man was part man and eagle, part man and horse, part man and lion,
how man got involved in his fantasies and got caught in the animal structure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Whose face is it?</span></p>

the caves T. has been telling about?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The caves have an
understanding of its own intoritor connection. In such you have the plagues of
disease and a quadtrope of understanding, balanced out with a singular secular
mind, and the forsay of the forte of power. In such an understanding you have
the attitudes of the kingdom of Heaven plus the reign of understanding in the
quadruple of the force of Domain in the earth. Such an understanding you have
the epitamy of mans consciousness in the earth and the developement of such in
the quatrains of society. E PLURUMBUS EXCELLEUM DEUS is a kind of a
consciousness that centers over the Domain. Basically with these elements you
have the beginning of an old old order built on the first dynasty of Egypt in
the year 20 BC, 20, 00lBC. You will find artifacts of dust and conglomerations
of power within the dust. There into center course it is below the conscious

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So that would be the cubit
that you gave. Would that be the way they derived it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We wouldn’t lie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What’s the 2.1?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: 2.1 over the 4th
power.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell me about
the unit that they used in building the Great Pyramid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It had to center
around the 144,000 mark.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is that one unit of
length?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Should be measured as
one, one, 1/4 of what would be a cubic length today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: 1/4 of 36 inches?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So it would have been 9
inches?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: 9 inches was the
apparatus of angle plus that of a 22 inch apparatus of length.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the width was 9 inches
like this and the length was 22?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: At an angle ().</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What was the depth of it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: All these would be 3
to 6 as you gradually going on up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What was gradual going on
up?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There is a slight
incline in different levels producing different dimensions as it moved forward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was this the sacred cubit
in use?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It would be
considered as that within man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And there was a different
cubit used for the exterior, the limestone part?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You would have
different levels of measurements for the outside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was all the prophecies
they included in this type of measurement?</span></p>

then the outward design.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was I correct in this
thing I did here that length equals the time. Like length in inches equals the
time and the width would equal space and like the height would equal?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Length and width can
give you that time and space and the height and the depth can give you that
what would be called pressure of the space.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Would that be like the
weight?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It could be
considered as such.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: About the cubit which I
ask about before. Before it talk’s about the length of the cubit being 28
inches. In the Session before last you gave a different aspect of it. I wonder
how, I can’t understand how they go together or how to visualize it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Ones the inner
structure and the other would represent the outer form of the structure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The 28 is the inner?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This would be taken
as such.</span></p>

the outer structure?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This would be the shield
around more or less. You also have a invisible layer that hasn’t really been
manifested on a conscious level. The preservation of the Pyramid had come from
this very thin invisible layer, surrounded the structure itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: A cubit is not something you
can visualize like on a 3rd dimensional level?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It could be done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you. The story of
Job. Later it is verified in another book in the Bible talking about three (3)
entities and the way they talked about it sounded like Job wasn't a myth but a
prophet or a human being. Did he exist?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let us say Job did
exist as a brother of distance of Moses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When was the Book of Job
written?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Book of Job was
written at the time, one moment, please fetch me that Book please, yes. The
Book of Job was written by the time in which Abraham fought against the kings
of the earth. You would find this near the chapter 25 of Genesis. For here
fought Salin, or Salim, Shadain. It would be said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is my understanding
correct that Melchizadek was </span></p>

that...about Melchizedek that..</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Melchizedek was a
very busy person. He also changed stones and metals into a finer quality. He
was the one that took gold and made it purified. He was the one that took a
coal and made it into a diamond.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: By thought patterns?</span></p>

between the Book of Life and the Book of Knowledge?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: One is recording of things

apostles, that don’t worry, I’m leaving but I’m going to send another comforter
to you, and He is referring to the Holy Spirit, does that mean that the Holy Spirit
wasn’t around before Jesus?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The centers within
the body were not able to hold on to the Flame of Love, which opens up the

then?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, let us just
leave them at 14 doors. They apply to the centers beyond the 7 centers.</span></p>

but they do not go against the laws of God. I don't understand. I don't think
so. What was wrong?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There are many people
who come and tell you all the rights and the things that are wrong in the world

making what they consider truth, an untruth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could we know a little
more about Job?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Job represents the
fight within man to stay on the path to God, without getting deviated,
deviating to many other factors, excuses, and diversions. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: From those three friends,
the first one represents the physical, purity, and that's part of the fight of
Job. Would the second one represent the mental, then?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And the third one?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I see. So the third one
wasn't bad either.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The third one knew
it, but did not abide in it in his life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In the Book of Job how
does it go with the 14 stations of the cross, do they go with the first 14
chapters?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Book of Job deals
directly with the Book of the Dead, dealing with the Egyptian book that self
transcribed as the Book of the Dead. It deals with the transference of the
physical body into the spiritual centers of life. They transforming of
physical-ness and transforming it into a spiritual process. The 14 stations of
the cross can be alluded to the 14 chapters of Job and breaking it down on the
physical level for the first 14 chapters. This would have the effect and other
chapters to come finally manifesting the spiritual resurrection and the belief
of faith that had been tested.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Would the precepts go
along with the next 14?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The precepts can be
applied almost identically with this of the resurrection of the cells. It could
be applied according to that of the pulse of time and of shape.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Would it be the middle 14?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes this could apply
to the center part of this existence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Its called I&#8209;ni(?initiate).
The Book of the Dead. This is one of the scribes in which recorded the psychic
readings, revelations of the spirit world to those around, giving the proper
information of what happens for the soul moving from the earth into the ethers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Does the word itself I&#8209;ni

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is this the initiation in
the Book of Job like the Book of the Dead. Is this the initiation that a person

that posed all these problems to the initiate?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They are what you
would be considered a fixed posing problems, a fixed initiative problems or the
a I&#8209;ni or in the Hall of the Eyes. Your first initiation that all must go
through is the concept of logical mind versus faith. This is your first
initiation that all those must go through in order to perceive God. And it is
tested 3 times by the High Priest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: It talks about the 13
rules for interpreting enigmas. Is that the same as I was reading about before.
Would that be the same as the 14 precepts?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Wait, wait, wait,
wait, there are certain rules and regulations of interpreting the finite, the
infinite, and the astral etherical levels of laws. When they coincide with
certain elements of the earth, they must be dissected individually, broken down
like you have in chemistry or the microscope. The breaking down of elements to
the finite particle is not, repeat, is not going to get the finished answer.
Taking the sum total of it and expanding it could not give you the sum total.
Either way can only give you more roads of movement through knowledge. It is
accepting the item as is and receiving the totality of that item from the
minutes&quot; quality to the infinite quality in balance and retrospect. This
can give only that true knowledge of the item. The 13 laws can break down a
particle as in chemistry, in such there 13 steps of infinite ties in the
elements of the earth, causing a gyro spectrum finishing product of bringing
you back to the expanded search of illusion. What we're trying to say in
elementary terms is that when you bring an element to the finite quality, the
finite quality brings you to the expansion. In such you are running after your
own tail. So accept the item as the item in front of you and receive the
totality of the item from the beginning to the end, through intuition.
Intuition properly functioned in the spirit of man since the beginning of time.
If man only tuned into intuition rather than the telescope he would have the
answers to all his problems. Set the ideal in front of you and the mark will
soon be recorded. As we say here, Das Dos Daes Munas. As what was in front of
you is also in back of you. As what was in back of you was in front of you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: As in the beginning so in
the end.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=FR style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, cat et
tail.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So actually just as
everything else is infinity and there is no ending, so is also if anything is
broken down to everything that they can break down and there they are going to
break it down some more, they are going to find the first element that they looked
at the very beginning?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Talking about a riddle the
other day you said the ethers about the earth wasn’t affected by this. How does
that work?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There are certain
laws and messages within the earth that cannot be revealed openly. The only way
these laws can be revealed to the subconscious area is through riddles. It is a
doorway in which the Law of Revelation comes through without being stopped by
Satan. It is through a riddle that information of how to handle situations and

same thing?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: In reality the 3 High
Priest still exist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And the first initiation is
faith versus mind, is that the first?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Faith versus the
logical mind and the worldly mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In that case there is
nobody beyond that first initiation, almost nobody?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes and no, I mean
there are those who do pass logical mind, have given it to faith and moved on
to that of will and love.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I see, so you cant really
go on to will unless the other ones is finished and is it also here tested 3
times?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is tested in 3
different aspects, correct. Once during the year it is given to a person, one
period during a year to go(grow) for this particular test.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is it a different time for
each person?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes we do have a sort
of shift cycle. Would be heavy if everyone went through it at the same time.
You will take your birthday that you are born and you would take that add 69
days to it. With that is called the lunar cycle. With that you will add to the
solar cycle a 104 days. Then you will minus the star period which is a blessing
period. That take away 18 days plus 4 days. Don’t ask me to repeat this its
impossible. When you have the 4 days after you have the 18 days, you take that
4 days, after the 4 days you again add for the lunar period 68 days and that
will be your answer for each individual cycle test. You will pay 5 dollars for
that. That is when each one of you will go through that particular test period.
Leap year you will minus the 68 instead of adding the 68 days. At the end that
is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In the beginning in the
Book of Job it talks about Job. Where exactly is he at? Is he in a sarcophagus,
already like being in a tomb?</span></p>

carry him on to the Higher One?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In the beginning of Job,
in reading it over I still can’t understand how it was affected his initiation
that he lost all his family. And how was that given to an initiate, how was
that presented before him when he was being initiated?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: He was taken away
from all family structure for a period of 4 to 5 years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: My understanding of Job at
this point, that Job cannot happen unless that particular entity has to reach a
certain point of perfection?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And the second thing is
that Job cannot happen unless there are friends?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Job represents also
the planet earth and the friends are the other planets around the earth, Mars,
Venus and Mercury.</span></p>

you said the 3 planets around the earth are the 3 friends and […] said that if
the 3 friends weren’t there they would not have gone through the other
chapters. How do the other planets influence us to make us go through more
things?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Very basis, the more
the planets, the more the influence. on the body and the spirit in the earth.</span></p>

14 crystal lattices have to do with everything I’m working on or if they can be
used with it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This deals with the
many fine receiving elements within the body. There are elements within the
body that also have the capability of receiving, and in so doing it gives the
foresight and intuitive experience of the receiving for its birth and process.</span></p>

much. We had taken certain elements of the animal world and preserved it by
solar energy. Not by freezing it. But by keeping it at it's normal state. Then
letting the wind take it’s course and blowing it into the air. For in the wind
factor, is the factor of reincarnation. For it is the wind that gives the

built a small Ark and used sound to expand it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Noah had no other
choice but to build a small ark in the area he was working. He did not own
enough land to build a large ark. As the flood came the sound was heard and the
ark grew bigger and bigger.</span></p>

first 4 names of God written in the Bible in Hebrew and each letter will fill
your spots in what would be considered as taking the letters and putting it in
the shape of a rectangle and every second letter will fill the spot necessary.
Then when all spots are filled and returning remaining letter. That is your
first letter, then your remaining letter in the spots that should, taking all
second letters first, then go back and fill in the remaining letters.  First
four names of God in Genesis in rectangle. Second letter of each name, even
letter first two and four are just two letters. Second letter of each name.

represent the force-field of words in the books. You take the Bible and open
the book and each line is filled with color put your hand across and you are
releasing electricity. Sleep on it and you will be a bumper bumpedo. Every word
is a color. Every sentence is a diagram. Every page is an evolution. Every

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The rectangle I had a
dream about it. Is there some kind of law, a formula or something that goes
along with rectangular ships as far as having more space than a square ship?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The law is founded
upon the invisible spheres, in which the rectangle is the symbol of. From this
all forms of energy and shapes expound upon.</span></p>

a physicist tries to calculate the optical properties of a material or the way
an object will behave in the presence of light, the hydrogen constant, or 1.037037
inf. enables him to make his experimental results fit theories which may be
largely based on incorrect assumption. The constant says Harleston, should be
particularly useful when humans will have to cope with very large amounts of
energy. In twentieth century physics, 37/27 or 1.037037 inf.is the physical
constant which forms the connection to the levels of the aQ: (adam). Multiplied
by 100, this number is the average fine constant for hydrogen and deuterium, a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The Book of Numbers
belonged to the school of the Weavers?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell me about
the school of the Weavers?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is a form of
Words and Magic, of making a thought forms around about with words, and of
force fields around that. Which is called the Weavers of Thought Forms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is it true that some day
man can make a space ship and all that is needed is the right symbol and force
field with the thought?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Man is the space
ship, he needs not to make one. One day he will find out that he can travel
anywhere with the right thought form and symbol, yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What was the opening
sequence which the Transformer used to predict the future?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: T PAR to the 14th
power times to the infinity of the space divided by the length of density.
Density divided by time equals the distance of circular calculus, equals the
total space. This will give you an understanding of the making of the pyramid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What does T PAR to the
14th power mean?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: T PAR to the
4th...14th power. TP means the top of the TP. The top angle leading to the
point of the pyramid, of the east side of the pyramid. The AR is the angle of
decent, and the shadow cast of the pyramid on the solar equinox. 14 is the 14
chambers that are reflected on the solar equinox, which would reflect the
different shades of darker stone on the pyramid, reflecting the areas of the 14
chambers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What does it mean to the
4th power?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Represents the power
in which one is looking into and defining it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is the definition of scale
as G. talk’s about related to circular calculus?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What is circular calculus?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Circular calculus
works in many different variances according to the geographical and also the
sphere in which you exist. Circular calculus is a dimension in which is call
the angles of vision versus the angles of unseen dimensions. It is the
measurement of the seen to equal or equate that of the unseen. Everything casts
a shadow and the circular calculus is that of the circles of circles of
measurement throughout the galaxies of variances, and the variances need to be
taken into consideration from one galaxy to the next. Each variance has its own
regulations, laws, and also mode and also degree and diagram and answer. You
must also understand that each solar system has its own number and each solar
system is canceled or checks the other calculus from the solar system prior.
This knowing all the calculus’s within the circular orb gives you the total
distance of the future versus the past. With it many things can be predicted,
not only of plant life and growth of stone and that of materials, but also the
circular vegetable and mineral and what would be called (Ah Auric, Ah Ecoscopy
Vision).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When a person is weighed
before death and then after death there is a difference in weight. Is this what
you are talking about? The soul weighs a fraction of an ounce.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is the spirit
world measurement of the spirit. Its called that of the equations of positive
force versus negative force and constant movement. Spirit is constant movement,
that’s it, theory and equation and answer, constant movement. If you put
yourself in a sphere that you predict yourself to be, then you can see what
your past was about, constant movement.</span></p>

how did they get that knowledge?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The lineage of the
line and the length of line of the latitude and longitude of the solar energy
coming from the earth because the strength of the vortex of that area dictates
when it falls back down into the earth in 2002.</span></p>

clues on how to deal with it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: These lines in which
they transect the way they are formed in the circle Pattern. Remember the peck
is the circle, it is called a circle peck. Now remember this that of such a
line there comes a form, it is now 287 and that is what would be a form. 287 is
the centering number of this equation, dissect that and you will get 41236180-0
or point 0 for that is the equation of what would be called the vortex of the
Nordic Star. Remember the Star is not a Star of the North, it is called the
Nordic Star and of and under such a path comes the Great Russian Bear. The
Russian Bear is the symbol of all equations that have been squared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Just another hint about
the calculus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You will find that
the answers we have given you will serve and are accurate to the very point of
discovery. When you discover the numbers, you will find that backwards will be
forwards and forwards will be backwards. Not to give you semantics here, but
the answers you are looking for in some particular parts of the scheme is that
it materializes on a spirit form first, then taking its shape on a physical
form second, it materializes in the ethers first, only to materialize and
manifest on a physical later.</span></p>

if anything and what would it look like if I could see it and how could it be
recreated on a 3<sup>rd</sup> dimensional level by us?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: More or less the
changing of the rays in certain areas and coming in of rays to fulfill certain
other things. You got to understand that there are rays that do precede action.
Before any action on a worldly level ever happens it happens on the astral
level and of course as we start speaking about the comet coming into the earth,
there are rays that come into the earth to affect your astral bodies. How to
manifest this and describe it, this is of the spirit and if you just use the
hand and let the spirit guide you the rays will take over and do exactly what
it wants to create into the earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The projective geometry
that I’ve been working with, do I understand it right that it goes along with
the Book of Formation?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Trigonometry?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Their will be a new
math discovered or invented from trigonometry of course. It works on a complete
opposite of the spectrum of the circle wheel. Of course the wheels take it in
and divide it, but then it goes at a different angle and the circles cut at an
angle and from that direction a whole new mathematical position can be
described. ( A circle in 45 degree angles.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The pendulum that I was
reading about, is that dealing with what you talked about, the right angle to a
circle you would find the new math?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We would find that to
be true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Circular calculus do I
have the right idea to divide a circle into 45 degree sections or into 8 parts?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: At certain times yes,
not all the time. Other times is to be remaining it into its whole total-ness.
There are different seasons for that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Do I understand correctly
that Trigonometry you are talking about is in the wheels of the Ships?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you explain how it
works and what I need to work with?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Wheels of the
Ships is the Wheels of the Devas or the Wheels of the God Force. It is the
Wheel that Daniel speaks of in the vision. It is also the Wheel that when (is)
stationary creates that of the Elohim and Yahweh in the creation of man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Solid work is something that
we have discussed and made every opportunity to see the solid work in our
countries and our forms of life. This ability is being focused and manifest in
China. We also see that there are some calculus’s of the power D to the 3rd
power over the velocity equals the distance traveled. What we are saying is the
explosive or the ignition, igniting of the (roctus)(eruption)(eruptive) gives
you the catapult force. And the force is then in l G to a next. The same force
then descends and gives you the velocity of descent. And also at the same time
gives you the distance of the descent and height to the descent. This here
formula is also the formula to Life itself. In which life is given its
strength, it goes to a point and then it is changed to different force. That’s
how human nature is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: I give you the speed
of light: 1,862,823,603 per half second. When one has reached this vibration or
this thought form, which one can reach in meditation, he can literally move
himself out of the earth. The speed of light when you have reached it, is 100,
or what would be 430,000 per second in this life or this circle lineage. What
would be 432.000.000 times one. Which is that of how many years would pass, for
your years it would be 430.000 thousand years, if one minute in our dimension
you have entered into. That is the analogy and that is the answer of if you do
step into what would be known as the 4th dimension for one second of a minute.
That is how many years would pass by. As one has a vehicle in which one does
travel throughout the eons of space, that vehicle does terminate into an
existence into the fourth dimension. Solid-ness disappears and becomes flat and
no longer exists. Therefor all molecules are turned upside, inside out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: 14 Stations of the Cross?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The speed of light
receives its own propulsion through different stages and there are 14 stages it
must reach in order to be effective and become the speed of light. In this
respect each stage represents a different consciousness evolution in that of
giving up of certain qualities and elements until finally is reached a point of
dormancy. In its dormancy it reaches its maximum state of efficiency. Speed of
light when it is interrupted by a straight line becomes what we would call the
speed of aught, of the speed of distance, of the speed of silence. When the
speed of light is interrupted it is thrown into a different scale of
measurement. It goes into the speed of a vacuum, causing the speed of a vacuum
to be the speed of distance, of shape. E they say equals MC squared, which is
the distance times space, but we say MC squared versus the aught or auk. MC
squared divided by auk equals infinity. Auk is a symbol used which would
constitute that of dividing the systems of sound and distance in complete half
and at its rate, if divided in half, that distance formulates space. In between
that division one finds total stillness of space.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Auk?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You could use the
number 0 cut in half with a line at an angle. Auk is simply a half a circle
with a line at a 43 degree angle going through it. Auk is to you a circle half
or halved with an angle of 43 to 45 degrees angle going through it. Going from
sunrise to sunset.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In the book of &quot;The
Concealed&quot;, they are talking about the crystal. Is it crystal with the
other elements?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Indirectly. The child
helps keep balance of a moving object or &quot;x&quot; amount of times the
speed of light.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell me what the
Beard of the Ancient One represents?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is the energy flow
of the Universe through the creative abilities manifesting the force of Wisdom
and the ability of constructing material buildings and strengths into the
earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell me the
difference between the Vast countenance and the Small countenance?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: One deals with a
outer radiance, the other one deals with the inner mechanisms and the inner
radiance that surrounds the large sphere of outer force or outer energies. One
a whole complete set or different city versus another city.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q Is it through the crystal

tendrils, tendrils of strength revolving around the center point of pivot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell us how the
Weavers Beam controlled the giants?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This point of energy
was used to control the uncontrollable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How did it affect the...?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: On the nervous system

Elisha’s staff. What is this staff?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This was the magical

as in a session.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is this Mose’s staff?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It was the
communication channel. The staff that was open and passed down from generation
to generation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was it with Adam?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is a point of
brain mechanism of direction.</span></p>

you sat around, like in the ship there was a table and the 144,000, is that
represented in man by like the 24 nerves?</span></p>

each gateway has 6 aspects?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It represents as you
would call it the yin and the yang. The positive and the negative. The
vibration of foods taken in and foods repelled or extended outward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: That’s 12 taken in and 12
out?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Every day we take in
12 and give out 12. There are those whose ying is different from their yang. In
short, too many souls are taking in too much new and getting strength upon
strength and not giving out, therefore, producing a smothering effect. As the
energy comes in it must be given out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So its like 24hrs a day?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: 24hrs a day. 24
weeks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is that the reason why
some people have energy all the time?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The energy is also,
could be too much yang. We feel here we are discussing in Chinese the structure
of the universe. Too much energy is just as harmful as not enough. There should
be in the middle path of balance and harmony and contentment and peace that we
all strive for in our daily living. The meditations bring us to that equalizing
point in our bodies. And every time we meditate we are again starting from the
center line and moving forward on that until we again deviate from it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is it like it talks about
in the Kabbalah as one thin line with 13?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What are the 24 Elders?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: These represent the
shades of light within our consciousness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Guiding the
principles and ideals of rights within us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In Revelation chapter 4 it
talk’s about those who will exalt the glory of God, those are the ones that
will be placed on the sea of glass. What is the sea of glass?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The sea of glass is
the ability to travel and see also physically the other dimension, the ability
to travel from one force-field to another and from one planet to another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: It also states that those
who are on the sea of glass are protected from the other forces. Is there some
type of force-field around that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Oh yes, it is a
platform of movement.</span></p>

have in the room relate to all the, go along with the Breastplate and all
the..?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The cube is the
creation of everything within and without. And it is from this cube that the
earth or the Universe was formed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When it talks about in the
Book of Concealment and the Book of the Greater Holy Assembly, about the
Ancient One, is it talking  about the cube and the different things that go on
inside it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes. It refers the
internal relationship of the Master Plan of Development along with the external
manifestation of such a plan with the environment and element around and its
development forward in the perfection of that plan through certain laws and
structures and systems that must be followed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was the cube that they
used, Simeon Ben Yohai, it seems that he used one or he visualized one and the
different parts of it in his writings and I wondered how they used it to
meditate on, or the use of meditation as described before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, just visualizing
it suspended in space and understanding that the lines illumined in a sarco
deco glow condition, which would help the soul inside attach itself, from into
an outer consciousness and bring it more on a surface level for manifestation
in which at any time the students would discipline themselves of closing their
eyes and tuning themselves to the symbol of peace, this would be an interesting
lesson to learn. That one would set in his mind a symbol of peace and
contentment and build it up, that when tests and trials do come one can
immediately close their eyes, picture the symbol and let that symbol convey the
relief and message of healing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: With the model of the
Universe I just made would that be the same as a molecule of Gold or some other
element?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The form of the
structure is the form that is the cube and the diamond that is being worked on
at this moment. This is a Solar Cell. (?the cube)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is this correct the
octagon that I made each of the things coming off the faces. Each face being
like a calculator about the center of the universe?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We find your design
to be correct. Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you explain how this
model operates from the center outward. How the energy flows?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: More or less it is
extended through the 4 arms north, east, south, and west. Extending into the
relatively span of the circle that it formulates. Creating a energy flow above
that which continues on and on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When you look at a certain
angle at the cube it seems to me that I see the Tree of Life in a 3 dimensional
form. Is it true?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Again yes this is
true. It is formed within the circle with its own responsibility and paths. It
is formed within the circle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How does this diagram go
along with the form that I made of the Bible, the Five Books with the Gospels
and Revelation?</span></p>

form hovers above this. What you have just mentioned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How is music evolved
within the cube of the Universe, all the different lines?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Music is the space
between the lines. Music is the space that is in the cube itself. The emptiness
of space is that music that is formed by the lines itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is the cube of 3 the best
one to visualize?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Would it be the sequence
of numbers like the magic cube of the diagram 42?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: 48.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What color would be each
cube and what color would be the number on it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Starting from that of
the Gray to the Ultrasonic Blue to the Iridescent Green.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Each cube would be
different?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Relatively, yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So each cube would add up
to 48?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: 48 is the number.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Prime Radiant cube and
psychohistory numbers?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Square it with that
of the hypotenuse(future line)to the right angle. Picture you will see.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Right angle triangle: Base
line equals past, Height equals present, and Hypotenuse equals future.
Hypotenuse not only represents the future, but also represents that within the
body that extends from it and gives life to those that creates or those that is
created. One does not only give life, but the most essential part of life is
the creating of life, and in such, the creation of creation is life more than
that of life itself. The creation of life is that of any form of expression in
the arts is a very high sphere of glorification and therefore this represents
the glorified line. Past makes up the present, but the present also makes the
sum composite of the future.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What does it mean when you
say by your numbers, since there is no time in your dimension, how do you
number things?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Simple, we just do
it. There is no time doesnt necessarily mean that time is the element of
numbers. Numbers is the thoughts or the square root or that which is the object
of the spirit. The spirit is the measurement of time through numbers, or number
through time to the spirit. Mathematicians are nearer to God than what would be
known closer than those who do not even know how to worship.   Mathematics are
the laws of God in the physical eyes. Numbers in any galaxy or any universe is
the same, for they are universal, they are truth. We do not need time for
numbers. For numbers are a different component of what time would be known as.
There is a point in which mathematics can be used, but when it reaches that
point it becomes nothing but mental. It is like two lines joined together and
when they meet they form two other lines going out into space to infinity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct. But there
are many different ways we do it. You have to listen to how we stop and how we
go. You have to listen to where we put more emphasis on and take it away. And
that is how we speak. 1point 3 point 4, then you could be 134 point. Then it
could be 134 period. And it could be 134000 point 00 point. Then it could be
134. Then it could be 1 point 3 pint 4 point. Then it could be 134 point. Then
it could be 13 point 4. There are many different ways of saying 134 point or
whatever you are speaking about. If you understand what I have said then you
might as well come here. Mathematics, Universal Language, like unto Music, Art,
the Flame of Life. Simple you must listen to how I say it.</span></p>

a life-span and are they born, do they die?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They are born every
single time you have an electrical storm. Thousands of little people are
created and reclaim the area for their dominion, of course a lot also get
removed at that time too.  How are they, they are very sensible individuals and
very capable of reading your thoughts. If your thoughts are in harmony they
will help you. But if your thoughts are not in harmony they will go and do
everything against you. Some live in trees, some live under mushrooms, some
live on blades of grass, some live on rocks, some live under the rocks, some
live under the waterfalls, some live on the drops of the waterfall, some live
on top of the water, some live on moss. The best type of entity of little
people grow near moss, green moss and usually when you have green moss growing
near you, it is the luckiest little people to have, because it brings wealth.</span></p>

decision world. The earth represents the decision of the factor of the Spirit
versus that of karmetic force. What would be accomplished at this point is
lining up in its own fractions and forming it in a compass of silver threads or
not silver, but silver strands or the effect of the silver strands at lengths
of 1 to 3 feet in the center. Being formed as you move along. After that there

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This represents the
cross of anatomy which man has been developed in which when Adam was created
before the carnal flesh, he had a fork or pitchfork effect in which male female
was balanced in his spheres.  When satanic forces evolved it forms a third
prong in which had represented the between interference between that of the
male gender and the female gender or the male cosmos and the female cosmos or
the male sphere versus the female sphere. It also represents that in which
everything has been created and developed to, in which as a tuning fork or
point of interest in that cooperation there is always that of the male female
and it is up to us to decide the middle section, that of satanic or that of
spiritual. We have a great understanding of that of satanic force, but we have
little understanding of its effects. We have also a great understanding of the
spiritual force, but also no understanding of its (causal, casual) effects over
the period of time, but we have more reality and data over the causal effects
of spiritual matter than satanic matter. In the pitchfork reliance or
acquisition this enlightens the brain and sees that which is heard. Then as a
force that is considered the (Knowing your centers) could be found in a
religious bookstore. Knowing the balancing the centers which describes the
pitchfork aspect. Books not what we are interested in. It represents again that
growing or evolution channel in which man must enter into male and female
together, balancing out both factors and bringing it into a middle path in
which all creation and relativity and all devices of discovery must coincide,
comprehend and also align itself to the constructive and egressive posture,
ability of what would be considered that of creation.  From creation all is
made from this first principle that is set down in theory on paper or thought
first, then put into the ethers paper and then put into a physical mobile and
supplies that of the energy in which would create a new force of endeavor. Your
prayers(are our)(or&#8209;are)thoughts and understanding is creating a force
field around the house. It will get bigger and bigger and thicker and thicker
as time goes on, which will allow a tremendous force of good and spirit to
hover and cling on too. This gets larger and larger to the point of a sphere of
strength and this then takes over and starts creating on a physical level the
cities that are formed on a spiritual.</span></p>

a ship. Sphere of strength when it reaches this point it builds, creates of

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: By the very nature of
its factors creates of itself, very nature of its facts. Lines of six can be
interpreted as such. It is also the strength of every given place in building.
Each place has 6 lines and each building has its 6 lines in all the force, and
the lines is not only landscaping, but also seascape and that of building has its

etheric or the Entity of lights. Man was incorporated into the Lights which had
a specific number from the beginning of time registered in the archives of
time. When the Son of God came down into the earth, he radiated a number. The
number was the radiation of all manifestations of his being, and his being
manifested all sorts of numbers. Then came into fruition the existence of that
which is the beginning of the number. All numbers have been recorded since the
beginning of time. From the beginning of time the manifestation of every
component commodity in which he or she or it or thing or anything that has life
or being is considered of a molecular or domestic level number, each number
having its being again since the beginning of time. Therefore the Deity of the
Spirit of Natural Archives of God Itself knowing to be the Divinity of the

Shape-changers the common denominator to all world factors in which
incorporates the evolution of man and the spirit of man within the body
physical, mental and spiritual. This encompasses the growth, the dominating

created the mind and what was the original purpose of the mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Into the aerobus of
the creatures which we call the protoplasms or the cellular nucleus of the
ventorite of mankind came the cell beings or the structural light fossils of
mind matter, or protoplas. Protoplasma is the general structure of mind cells
in which a function if you will understand as a stimuli never really
experiences outside of itself, never really touching the 5 senses or the world
in which it is concentrated; in which the mind is of a tree in which it has
branches, and the leaves, but never really touching the roots, but the tree is
still strong within its own solid ground. It has been said that the tree has
its own fossils when it falls to the ground, in which the lichens form into its
own perplexities, forming that which is creation before the tree was. These
lichens form into a different variety and factor, in which the plant food for
the nurturing of the tree and the forest beneath. In the forest you have the
procreation of that which is the density factor of the Z power, which has been
spoken of, and all of this is the substantiation of light. The light is the
consecrated form in which all essence of matter has come from. Light is what
would be considered the OXI power in which out of all substance or
transformation or transluxation light has the subculmination and cocreation of
matter. Without matter there is no light, but without light there is matter. In
and on all instances all light of matter is that substance what is the
vibratory and the exploration of the cellular and the (protoplenus) of the
mind. Mind is the substance in which the (protoplenus) and the cellular
structure of the density of protoplasm from the beginning of time has its
substance. All this is a combination of the creature man, and of course it,
what would be considered, in the seer of the 4482 or times that or cube that to
22.1 in the centimeter of the formation of the area of mind brain cells. The
brain cells is linked together in what would be considered a scallop or
microscallop formation, forming what would be called lintograph of hereditary
cells. Lineage or circumspect of height of evolution which man is in a period
of 1.4 hundred or 1.4 thousand years as created a evolutionary cell in which
that cell takes 1.4 thousand years to develope within the characteristics of
man. This characteristic is (ebedomized) or immobilized or embodied, emblucated
into the cellular scallop structure of this mind or the brain. The brain is
only the aftermath of this mind. The brain is only the aftermath of the sunlit
structure in the light form which takes up substance the XY power. The XY power
creates the substance within the skull. The skull only the housing or the tent
in which has power. Mind or the substance of, or the cellular scallops
substance or the configuration of the secular, or scallop sections of the
(fallopeses)cells, forming the skull. The skull is formed in such a manner,
that 1.4 thousand years enlarges with each experience; then one experience is
developed, the cell or the addition of the (thymalos cell or the (thymalene)
cell is formulized into the higher bracket of the brain, or the cellular
structure of the scallop forman, what would be called the counter scallop, or
the convex scallop cell structure, forming an outer bin or what would be called
a bowl. A bowl is of a form in which it arches at a 90 degree to 44 degree
angle, starting at a 44 degree angle and pushing into a 90 degree angle. This
in turn (suces) as the scallop or the subscallop structure of the segment of
the force of the brain moves the structure not only in appearance of the brain,
but forms brain to be more etheric in matter or substance or style. The link
density to the XY power of life, forcing matter or cellular structure of
scallop or the center scallop or the overall to be called transmuted or
transformed into a light or into an arc power in which the cellular surface
scallop, subscallop or (suprasubroid) forms from the matter of mass at 1.4
thousand years to the XY power, which light is the density in which density or
light cubed or Xed to that power formulizes the path in which the son of man or
God or man is known as the evolution to what would be called, transmute the and
making the internal cells more of a (osmolite) or (asmolene) type of experience
in which there is no longer a density, but more of a vaporous, vaporized
rendition. This vaporizing is the sum total of freeing the mind out of the
physical, transmuting the physical body as an aftermath of the brain cells.
Mind. Mind transformed in this area or this way has power of making the body
much lighter in density, making what you would call transubstantiation happen.</span></p>

electrical vibratory energies come from the cellular structures of the mind or
of the brain wave forces that transcend all understanding and also remain into
or of contact with all forces they do meet. Thought has the power to create and
also the power to destroy. Thought is the image of God also. Thought is the

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Numbers and perceiving?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Certain times numbers
can be handed out and people sitting in certain positions can relieve or reveal
certain elements of that factor number, of the day, the hour, the week, the
month, the year, can also reveal a type of day, what type of position is being
worked out. All these are the ups and downs of that quality of perceiving.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How does number relate to
perceiving in detail?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Numbers have a great
magical power of energy and force field in which the numbers align themselves
to capture this energy around the earth. To focus it into your visual phase.
They kind of break down the energy patterns so you can see and perceive in the
application of forms that they represent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Psalm quote ‘and they
misused the instruments’.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: These are the, there
are many different instruments the Israeli’s had. They  had the instruments of
creation and the instruments of energy and light. And the power to move things
and they had the ability to perceive things and receive things. Also the
instrument of giving fore-knowledge and information, which became abused. Also
the instrument of maintaining and subduing the beasts, for during Moses time
there were many beast qualities still left on the earth, that these instruments
of sound waves or focal points of reflectors had control over. And they used
these beasts for their own wants and desires.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What is the Weavers Beam?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Weavers Beam is the
staff or the energy of  Authority and is inscribed the Laws of Man since the
beginning of time. It also is a factor of receiving all sound waves through
them and producing an energy charge around it to control unseen rays.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But they actually had that
Beam in which they actually could, is that part also  of what you answered in
previous question, with their ability to change matter, things like that, lift
things?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Ephod. What is it? How did
it answer? What did it consist of?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is a complex
question to be given a simple answer. We could say an ephod is someone who has
a spiral shape horn 40 to 27 feet long, in which the response would come when
the wind would blow through it giving messages from the spirit world. Not like
spooksville but more of a talking, eloquent message breaking down through the
27 foot spiral shape.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What was the purpose of
the ephod and how they worked it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Project the future
and the course of events. And it was projected to a crystal reflecting the
colors and the amber, reflections of the globe of the light. Giving them what
was really happening.(happens).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The covering between the
cherubims that was made of pure gold, how come God is saying I will come, I
will speak to you from that covering between the cherubims on top of the Ark?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is considered the
seat of the Voice of the Holy One, it is a speaking box, it creates a vortex of
energy like a horn and the horn is able to speak the voice of His from the
other dimension.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And that was done because
of this gold covering?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The gold covering is
the energy field that allows the horn to receive its vibration in its own
skull.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The horn was not a
physical correct?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It became physical
when it is ? (solid).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is it possible to
reproduce that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The University that
imitated the Ark in total. It created a great deal of insanity, therefore it
had to be stopped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And why did it create
insanity?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Because it revealed
the Truth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And God did not speak
through it though?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Oh yes He did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Why was the Ark the box
covered inside and outside with gold, not just the outside where it showed, but
also the lining was made of gold?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is a conduit of
this vortex or doorway to what had been carried on the Titanic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was there some sort of
mesh, something that was other than just the gold laid, was there something or
is it in the way the gold was laid out or?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is the way and the
mastership of its imprint. But it was the anti-field that it created, which was
more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: There is a theory that by
creating this covering that how aliens were contacted, something to do with
aliens, UFO’s or whatever, that would go along with that correct?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We can’t deny that.
It is what we have said a long time ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could  you explain anymore
about the Urim and Thummin?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is a force of
energy that comes into the earth to create and refine that which is dross and 
that which is heavy and gives power from above. Also a Symbol that is
recognized from the Higher Forces, left in the earth from the time of Atlantis,
to be called the Seal of the Government or the Seal of Wisdom or the Seal of
Inspiration and Information. It is that which is answering all complaints
toward those that you would know as today and with the (….) in writing as
regards these two plates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Urim and Thummin?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There is a way of
looking for them. Glare of a mirror, looking into the mirror and into the
direction of the planet sees picture of them. Glare of a gas or air looks in
the earth. The dew is a covering for them and use that in the early morning in
which they produce. How could find them or look for them? Formed in an energy
force field of the elements of the 3rd and 4th dimension. Not as creatures but
as the energy field we are talking about. Force of energy into the earth to
create and refine that which is dross and heavy. Gives power from above. Symbol
recognized by the Forces, to be called the seal of Government.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How many beads would be in
the thing you talked about before?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: How many beads? It
would be in the scale of the mathematical symbol one hundred. Give or take a
bead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How would they be arranged
in like tens or what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=DE style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In tens?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Tens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q Just string them on a
string or how would they?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: What we would have is
one layer of bead going up and forming a pyramid going down. One line would be
one bead. The second line would be two beads. The third line would be three
beads and so on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Till you get to a hundred
beads?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: On the fifth line the
bead doubles in value.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What does that mean?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: On the fifth line
each bead represented as twenty&#8209;five.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You mean that less the
number value when you&quot;re calculating?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How to use the Urim
calculator?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This can be used with
a proper attitude and with a receptive finger. The digits on the bottom could
be used parallel to the digits on the top. Straight lines and vertical lines
would represent one aspect and the other aspect lines would represent another
(in time). Remember this is a calculator not on a physical level, but it is of
a spiritual energy calculator. Beads represent different stages. Just take the
first four layers, what you need to do is just go through each bead one at a
time and do that eight time a day and it will formulate its own force field.
Then its calculations will not be on a mathematical level mind you but on a
subconscious level of healing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What does the Thummin
mean, from the last session that I asked about the Urim, you said it meant the
beginning, and the Thummin was said to be the end. So how would it be manifest?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What would be on the
square, would the be anything else added to the square to make the Thummin?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It would have four
stones on the corners and a hanging of one in the center.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell me if this
diagram I have of the Thummin with the stones on the corner, is that correct?</span></p>

the stone hanging in the center? Where does that go.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You would place it
three&#8209;quarters on the part facing the north, or more so, the center of
the platform.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And the other is like flat
and this is above it all?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This would be
considered hovering three&#8209; quarters.</span></p>

and Thummin acted like a magnet. Stone on forehead see through it. How did it
work?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There was a sensing
device to allow the receptively of light and variance and power to come in and
that focus of light was focused on the section of the third eye which could
heal the knowledge of this center. This and the law as far as this is
concerned, but the answers of receptively when it is placed near or over the heads
is the receiving of information from the third eye and the storage of this
information no matter how minute or small it might be. This is called the flow
(fluxion)? of energy in the receptive part of understanding of this new energy
development.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How were the stones
arranged on the breastplate with the Urim and Thummin on it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Stones set in a
clockwise formation completing it in a circle and the minor stones would be
placed on the circle. Major and minor influences, this is part of the moving on
process. There should be no problem in the development of the set up for you.
As long as you keep your mind on the objective and purpose that is at hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: (?)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Stones arranged to
focus energy in the breastplate focus it on the white light. This in turn could
be focused by the breastplate,  to raise it up to the third- eye.</span></p>

Joshua there was this thing by which this, a tool by which they were able to detect
if somebody was guilty or not guilty, an indication of some sort. As far as I
remember this is the last time it is used or it is mentioned, after that the
thing disappears and in the dedication of Solomon of the Temple after he builds
it, one of the things that he is actually asking for is he’s asking that the
Temple should serve almost the same function as that tool was serving, but that
the Temple should serve it and he’s going on and telling to please this
particular thing and this particular thing, he mentions everything which in my
thoughts that tool was doing at that time almost automatically. In that respect
what happened to that tool?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Kind of broke down,
it was no longer used, it was kind of put out of existence.</span></p>

anymore to repair it or..?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well the tool wasn’t

itself disappear?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Within the man,

implemented it into their own body?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The gift itself or
the tool itself is not only physical, but it was also on an astral level too,
on a, a, a, a 4<sup>th</sup> dimensional level. The tool itself and its
components were simple items put together, but were no longer useful (? for)
these items.</span></p>

will find the answer to the questions around the 4 people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: By going back and forth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is a what you
would call a string thing ling theory coming from China. Sounds like something
you eat too. But the string thing ling theory is that information revolves around
the earth constantly. Inspiration revolve also around the earth constantly in
which when anything needs to be known it is up to the individual to tap into
that knowledge that surrounds the earth through many, many, many years of
learning. All learning stays around the earth. So all knowledge can be given to
anyone. All they need is time and patience to tap into it. By doing so you get
the answers. So 4 people dealing with the 4 elements of the earth, 4 winds, 4
sides concentrated on this knowledge which comes in through the different
sectors of the earth and rooms. Square rooms are not so difficult to receive
it, the more in accord, but round rooms seem to be more receptive to these
elements. Round rooms also create a certain vibration within the mind which
causes certain freaking out type experience. Therefore square rooms at the
moment of more congenial to society because of the inspiration and information
needed for the evolution pattern of its cycle.</span></p>

you gave along time ago, you told me once how to use it. Its on the spiritual
level. Could you give me any more on that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is a conscious
reminder of the panels that represent the ships instruments. But it also could
be used as a prayer center to get the mind attuned to the point center. Each
bead a certain prayer could be said on it. Dedicate a certain mantra and repeat
it as you go through. Each line represents the evolution of the spirit into
matter and matter up into the spirit. Each one represents a certain major star
within surrounds the universe of the earth. And each one bead represents a
major development of man&quot;s evolution throughout the ages divided.</span></p>

mantra be used, starting with one bead at the bottom and going to the top?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This could be done
taking the 144 psalm, the 5th verse and to dedicate a certain passage in that
verse on the first line. And then work itself all the way up and it is also a
good focuside, focusidation, that is it focuses on thoughts to be remembered and
certain feelings to be received.</span></p>

going through the whole schedule of the beads. Doing that for a few days and
then go on to the other verses in that psalm until the whole psalm is complete

Revelation, it does continue a form of different verses and continuations. Each
1st chapter of Genesis correlates with and can correlate with the first chapter

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> the pituitary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The Book of Knowledge
would be in the thyroid?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You would find
something similar yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And the Book of Life would
be in the pituitary? Speaking of the pituitary, would that be the sixth center?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You would find this
to be near correct. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Dream the triangle with
beads is the word of God?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Each bead represents
a certain atomic structure of the elements.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But the whole triangle
represents the name Jehovah?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct. The eye of
God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The name Jehovah, is this
the real name of God?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is part of His
Names. The name of God one cannot even speak in your language. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In the <u>TREE OF LIFE </u>book
there's one of the verses that says, &quot;Tetragramaton, thou made us in thy
mind.&quot; Who was Tetragramaton? Could you explain the verse?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Tetragramaton
represents the atoms of the earth, watcher or keeper of the earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is he one of the Forces?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We would say in the
middle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the Forces that created
him?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Partially.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And then it talks of a
shining point. Is that in the beginning would be a plain circle?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Uh Huh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And then the next step
would be a circle with a point within it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It could be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When it talks of 42
strokes coming into that what sort of figure does that make?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: 42 strokes represents
the 12 constellations, the 3 major stars within each constellation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Then where do you get the
total of 42?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: 42 is the major star
of governing source over each constellation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell me about
the seal of the 42 letters? Could you explain what that means?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This represents the
42 callings or names in which one can develop and receive certain benefits and
blessings with their own psychic development.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is it a certain
geometrical shape?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It could be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Can it be given what it
is?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You could have the
beginning of it in consistent with the diamond and the pyramid, the square, the
circle all in one with the square superceding both these items in the middle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is there a direct
connection between the sequence of the heart and the 42 names of God?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The heart is made out
of the 42 names of God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How do the 42 names of God
work within the Heart center?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They pulsate and
rotate around and rivet around the heart constantly. They are a certain amount
of heartbeats in the body of the heart and they are all destined from the
beginning of time. Each heartbeat is given a certain stroke. There are many
different strokes to the heart too, because they do take different strokes to
form different working(s). So there are certain strokes for one work and
certain strokes for another. This is the pulsation of the strokes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: If Levi is the heart as
you said just now and Judah I understand before was the heart. How do they go
together?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There is a division
within the heart. Four divisions. Levi and Judah takes control of the upper
part. And you have Benjamin and Simeon who would take control of the lower
heart. Simeon being the weakest in the heart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you explain with the
42 letters does it work with the heart like when you repeat a prayer so many
times?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Definitely, yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How does that system work,
when it starts repeating itself in the heart?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well we will go into
that as time goes on. It changes the molecular structure and the internal gyro
of the heart to a positive ray. The heart when it is born into the earth is in
a negative field and man lives on the earth and in his living through prayer
and service changes the heart negative polarity to a positive polarity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Can you help me some more
with the Glass Bead Game. I’m trying to realize something about it. Seems like
I never make it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well it does deal
with certain aspects of the development of the mind and the development of the
spirit at the same time. It must be taken slowly and not rushed into discover
and analyze their secrets, but just taking it as best as you can and it will
reveal whatever secrets that are there in time. We would say the particular
chapter that could go along with the particular game that you speak of would
find the Proverbs the 4th and 5th Proverbs to go along with the first half of
your book.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you help to see 3rd
dimensional an example of what we were talking about before, about the letters
and numbers and the words?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: More or less that of
a pyramid or(and) a octagon together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Also does it relate to say
that matter, force, and mind are the 3 creations, which one of these does it go
along with numbers, letters, and words? Does that go along with that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, you could apply
it to that, to the matter, the force, mind, this could be applied to that, yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Which one would go along
with like matter, would be the words?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Matter would be the
Word manifest, matter of fact.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And letters would be the
mind? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The letters could
stand and in a large percentage does stand for that, for the mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the numbers would
represent the spiritual and the force?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Numbers could
represent that of the accomplishment of the spirit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Isn’t the Glass Bead Game
part of on the physical level or partially on the mental level like what we
did, took the Bible and tried to put it into music but actually?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And then taking the same
thing, lets say like the Bible and putting it into numbers, which is very?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And that’s the mental
level, on the physical level is the discipline to get you to that point? Its
what we live here in the house?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This has some seeds
to it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And then the spiritual
thing is to actually come out of the two</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>other things, the pushing out
into it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes this has some
foundation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But on a mental level we
have actually begun that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes of course.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Does this go into, the
game itself, does it lead you into the spirit or is it just a mental thing
itself?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: () A certain
percentage of it is in the mental field, but there is part that does lead on to
a spiritual lesson(s).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In studying the symbol
I've been working on. What I call the Glass Bead, is the diagram of having a
rectangle and a diamond within, is that how the basic diagram of that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This could be done or
used or utilized ah to its full capacity and advantage, yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is that how it is in the 
-?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There are certain
changes here or there. The general concept is correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Does that mean that it is
a like a pyramid, like base to base and then within a rectangle like that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, you could
analyze it as such.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Also what is it, does it
relate to what you gave before on Noah's Ark, the diamond qualities of the
numbers?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, this is true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So its the same as the,
what’s given on Noah’s Ark, the same thing?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: More or less these
two elements were created to be the same.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So then the rectangle of
Noah’s Ark, would that be the best way to construct it, or does it make any
difference?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This would be the
best under the certain circumstances that you would be meeting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Since its very long would
there be more than one diamond in it or just one diamond?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Could be two to three
if you wish.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could any more be given on
the Glass Bead Game?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Glass Bead Game
is representing of certain centers within the body that must be purified and
crystallized and then refined to the point of giving up those qualities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could any more be said how
it was constructed? How it was done? Was it in the future?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: More or less like 3
squares put together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Flat or 3 dimensional?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They are 3
dimensional in a flat sense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Like a rectangle (of) 3
squares?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: With hung beads in
between?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could more be given about
the number of beads. Total number?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Could be 72, could be
105, could be 54.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q Is that on all 5 of
them(squares), the 3 different ones, that is the number on each of them?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Each one varies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The three sets of numbers,
how do they relate to the graph system? (105-72-54)Total 231 gates</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They are the apex of
each graph.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: On the numbers you gave me
the last session, the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>graph. You said each number
was the apex of the graph. Would the numbers 55, and 72 and 114 (105)
respectively be the physical, mental, and spiritual.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The three things that I’m
studying, numbers, letters and words, the three different temples that were
established in Atlantis, Yucatan and Egypt. Egypt would be the letters, Yucatan
would be the numbers and the words would be Atlantis. Would that be right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Also numbers are the
figures in which represent the powers of the grid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Do I have it in the right
order?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It will work itself
out in orders which will be more in harmonious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The thing that I said
before about the three numbers were you saying that it was in the wrong order
or the idea was incorrect?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: we weren’t talking
about those particular numbers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you give me an idea
about what you were talking about?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Talking about the
infinity numbers that surround them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Book (Game players of Zan)
talks about 2 games, 2 different groups of players, 1 being like the guiding
influence and 1 being space itself and playing against one another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Only then can one
move through time and space, when one is allowed to have some say, while the
other one is just there. This is inner space and distance. More or less the
thing that has to be done must take up movement in space and property that is
not there, then filling up that property with density. The density is what
would be considered to the third power in the x factor. Density is always
greater than that which is the x factor. Density to the third power equals the
cube of quality in the z level of appearance; therefore the z level of
appearance gives you the property of density. You could have the z level of
appearance in all before property or density, appears and dictate the density
and property that will manifest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Recursive math and graph
paper?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Do it in 3 columns,
and make it three, column, project. Everything in space takes up movement and
property. Then filling up this property with density. It is working with the 3
columns of the physical, mental, and spiritual, and the graph paper is the
height, weight, and the width of progress.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When a person speaks a
word describing something, we have many words, like shoe or anything. This word
is not the object itself. Doesn’t that communication prevent you from coming to
a true understanding of an object? Like when a person is speaking in an
everyday normal language discussing anything, lets say a shoe, a cat, a dog or
anything, you are pronouncing a word assuming that conveys a meaning, its only
registering on your ear though its just a word but in reality you don’t really
understand the essence of what you are talking about. How is that...?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Words have been given
to you through and handed down from generation, from generation, from
generation. Words had been communicated in the days of Greece. Words were given
to them through inspiration (inspiratos) on what would be considered receivers.
Receivers heard the sound, the sound was muted and as man became dense he put
it into sound(whoof). Therefore the words became handed down and you get all
sorts of sounds. But the real language that you are receiving is spirit and not
the words. The words, you might have a dictionary, it has all sorts of words in
it. It is not the words you are hearing, it is the spirit that you are
receiving through the words and not the words through the spirit. What we are
saying is you are. (End of tape) check.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: ....thing where if your
not receiving on a spiritual level, you identify, you just see the word. No
understanding. .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Exactly you would not
perceive into the spirit. But the spirit is camouflaged in the word.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is there a way to break
it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There is a sound
system that if you draw in a circle, you would receive all the colors of names
of God in those words or sound systems. Which is in reality the name of God is
mystiqued or clothed in the alphabet or the sound systems.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How is that sound system
broken down?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is broken down
phonetically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Taking the vowels and...?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The actual sound of
the sound is written phonetically and therefore phonetics comes from the
Phoenicians.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So you can take every word
and write it in a different form, which would be a more truer form, a more
truer sound?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes of course, yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell me how
General Semantics would be related to the Glass Bead Game, if it is?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is the breaker of
the barriers through the force of the notes and the use of sound from the tone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could any more be on how
that works?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: If properly utilized
the sounds can break through certain barriers that are invisible to the naked
eye and form a physical manifestation before the eye.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you. And the books
we've been reading dealing with semantics theories and creation of this thought
called &quot;Null&#8209;A&quot;, is there a pattern or is there something in
there that could help us in changing our ways of thinking? Is there something
we should look into further or some understanding you can give us of it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We shall only say it
is to think that which is on a higher plane, to think that which is
constructive. Semantics of thoughts is to simplify your thought and to bring it
down to the basics. In doing same, you shall tune within and bring yourself
closer to the God&#8209;spirit. Little speech. Little that of understanding of
words describing the material ethers. The less you know, the better you are.
The more you know, the mixed it becomes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Also concerning the origin
of the name English or Angels, was there an association or is there a link
between the Angle language of the Anglo Saxons and the language of the angels?
And how did this correlation come about?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The language is more
or less angular or put on or received at an angle. We won’t say its the
language of the angels, but we would say that they are very slanted people.
Angular Faxions (?Fluxions) comes from a point of those souls that had come in
at an angle.???(Who are at a turning point).</span></p>

is a strange person too, because you know, we could, but that wouldn’t help you
either, you know something he studied Sanskrit, that’s what he studied, the
Book of Sanskrit, Skrit-san, San-skrit, and there he learned many secrets of
the Universe given to the Tibetan people that moved from the Egypt area of the
Temple of Learning and went to Tibet, of course Tibetan rose up into the
mountains during the Great Flood, see. Now the same Book is located in the
Yucatan Peninsula of course, there are great books that are buried and you’ll
find them soon (so) many books. You know you should as a group make it a
chance, make it a choice, you know go to Yucatan and try to just experience,
cause a lots of books buried there, that are from the beginning of, of, of, of
creation. A lot of books have been buried there from Egypt, Atlantis of course
you know the route that they all took and all that. Course a lot of books have
been buried in Peru, you know Peru, yeah Chile and all that, you know, so well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You said in the Session,
Jesus studied the Koran in India. The Koran according to history wasn’t written
until the time, 700 years later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Koran was given
down from that of India into that of the Koran. It was laws of the language
that made the Koran to be written. The fulfillment of the Koran was already in
form before it was written.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was it in Sanskrit
originally?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell me what the
Glass Bead Game is? It talks about it in a novel I’m reading about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Glass Bead Game,
well let us put it this way, the image of self fighting ego and ego fighting
the image versus the Higher Self spirit coming down into the earth. This is
part of the bead symbol of touching and breaking one to the other. Simply the
reflections of our images versus the reflections of our ego, versus the
reflections of the spirit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is there an actual game on
the physical level where they use the beads in a certain way?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, there is a game
that goes on everyday of who will take control over that particular experience,
the ego, the spirit, the image, the mind, each by how we decide the questions
that are placed in front of us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But is there an actual
like the bead thing I made, the triangle?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well this will help
with the concentrate on this force within on this beads that are without.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is that what their talking
about though on the physical level would that be?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This will give you
some percentage of it. It is just the beginning of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: They said in there it
combines music and mathematics and philosophy like all in one thing. Does this
combine all that together?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The combining of this
is of a separate category. This is just the conquering of that concentration
and imagination of the power.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Session ?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The initiations of the
Master.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, We do meet in a
large chamber in our ship that is made of pure gold, pure gold. And the table
is made of an alloid that is hextnite or hextanite that floats in the air. It
beams forth into the physical body that we speak through. These wave&#8209;lengths
are force beams that penetrate all ten of his centers. If one center is out of
harmony, it would eventually destroy the communication. Therefore, if one
center is not in harmony, we would not be able to communicate with you now.
That is the physical structure and reason why these centers must be put into
harmony, so that you will be able to communicate with us, the regions of this
higher force. Our sphere of this room is pure gold so that the electrons that
pass through our vocal cords, through the thought forms alone do we speak here.
And these thought forms bounce off into this table of the sides which peruates
the light visions into his centers. His centers are now that are speaking, and
not his vocal cords. His vocal cords are moving, his mouth is moving only so
that you will perceive. But his centers are vibrating and this is what you hear
at this moment is the centers of this vehicle. The room is at least 5 stories high.
It would encompass 3 of the Empire State building in length. The numbers that
sit at this council is 144,000 in which 3 members of the higher deities speak
to you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We shall repeat the major
importance of the initiations of the Master. That this entities who will
achieve the mastership must first go it on a physical level, the phyneusical
connotations in which this entities or those entities must master darkness,
must master that in which his light is perminated through that center. The
desires over the fear centers, the leiden centers, the adrenal centers, and the
gonad centers come into harmony and balance. In such, all past karmas of those
or those entities that this master will meet will be tested if he is capable of
handling and controlling them. If not, they would destroy him at this test. The
next test would deal with what would be known as the thymus or that of will of
love, in which he is tested when he least expects it, he is to give up his life
and the life of his lives to come. This if he fails, he would be destroyed at
this moment. Then the next test will be that of the thyroid in which his will
is being done. All these will be done on his physical level of 40 days as you
will know it. All tests exists for at least 40 days. Then comes the highest
test of the pituitary and thyroid in which his meditation lasts for the period
of 3 months in one spot. Then at that point he is repruclated or what would be
know as regenerating his physical cells and transpiring them into a higher
force. Remember the thymus and the thyroid is the 3 days in the tomb. Also
which would be a replenishment of his physical body. Then comes the last and
highest of the tests, the raising of his physical dross body into his spiritual
body, which rises him to the ascension.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Does each person
eventually have to pick up his body of this earth like Jesus?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct. Everyone
will take home in a sack every atom, every cell that he had ever experienced,
she too, on the earth since the beginning of time. Isn’t that a wonderful idea.
Nothing is lost. God is the Great inventor of stinginess.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So in reality those 100
that people that you said made it, this is what you meant, they picked up their
bodies after they died came back and picked up their bodies?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: At the moment of
death their cells became ignited in Light. When the cell becomes spiritualized
it ignites in Light. The Light is eternal and moves and breathes and has, if
you look in your Bible, what was the first element that God saw that was
negative in the Bible. What I’m trying to say is what was the first thing that
God saw that was not. He created, He created, the first thing He created, He
created, but after creating He noticed something and what did he notice that
I’m speaking about, that you must have when you die to transmute your body
cells and burst into Light. When that happens you have raised your physical
body from the dead. You are a Light unto the soul. Isn’t that nice. What was
the thing that the Creator, the Elohim, the Deity, the Yahwey, the Zebaoth, the
Aveoth(?), what did He&#8209;She notice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Actually said notice, is
it the darkness?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There, right before
your eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So actually how did one
know if one was truly was a Master that picked up his body or if one just had a
heart attack?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: (laughing) Because
you will see the manifestation of the body in the presence. All the Masters who
had heart attacks could have been Masters but they have to keep on going in
their development, understand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: No.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is here (Yehasu
devaht isshi issha) understand. What this means in simple terminology is a
Masters Light you shall see. Better yet. The Light is Light for all to Light.
You will see the radiance of the Light in the Light itself. So a Master when he
truly has perfected his circle, his, his trial, his, his, his spiritualizing
his body cells, you will see it explode before your eyes and Light. Understand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You mean right at the
moment of death instead of the body being just a dead body it will burst into
light?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Now take that concept
right, take that concept and put it over here, okay put your hands and put it
over here. Now you just have taken that concept put it over here right. Here it
is you see, see the concept , this is a concept, anybody see a concept, see the
concept anybody. Now I can let go of this concept and its still floating. Here
you all see still there even though I take my hands away, remember that
concept. Have you forgotten the concept, ok. Then you have another concept
here. That is the body can remain in a perfect state, understand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: After death?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Does not decay. Until
the Christ Spirit comes back. And what happens then, there is a different thing
that happens. So that’s your second concept. Our body does not decay. Then you
have your third concept, the body decays, but the burst sends forth and the
burst of energy raises above the physical body and the spirit ascends upward.
So you have 3 conditions, the highest condition of resurrecting the body is the
burst and the Light and the Flame together rises the body, then you have the
secondary highest concept, the first being this, the second being the body is(
? ), and the third of course is not the worst but it is the lowest on the scale
of 3, the body decays, but the burst and the Light appears at the moment of death.
Understand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Yes. So in that case there
is definite physical signs to indicate a Master from just a heart attack?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And then for those people
in California?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Heart attacks, be
careful now, careful don’t jump. Jumping to conclusions on a spiritual level
can lead to trouble. Understand. The heart is the what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q The Love center?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No, no, no, no. The
heart is?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The resurrected spirit?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=ES-TRAD style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No, no,
yes. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Granted all these things is right.
The heart is the?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Flame?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Flame. When the
heart has a heart attack it explodes. Understand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So at that point?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It has manifested the
third lowest level of resurrection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: That’s the explosion, oh
so it doesn’t really have like a physical glow or something?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes it does. Did you
ever see a person who has a heart attack my dear. He is glowing. Look, watch,
see those majority of people who have a heart attack have fulfilled the 3rd
lowest resurrection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: My father?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Included.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So does that mean that the
heart attack isn’t necessarily a negative thing or a negative way to die?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No its not. It means
that has filled up with so much pain and turmoil and wanting to do and yet the
restriction of the earth has stopped it. And the hearts last battle is what, to
explode the Love into the earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is this like the phoenix
rising out of the ashes?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Right. Now the
concept can be suited as such, but the phoenix rising out of the ashes is what,
the spirit rising out of the body. Understand. And rising out the body is the
spirit that comes through here. Right. But doesn’t go through here mind you
when we die, as you do when you sleep, where does it come from. The bowl right,
the silver bowl. So in this particular course of learning the heart attack, what
you creatures see as a heart attack, nasty creature. But in reality it is what,
the fulfillment of the first resurrection. Isn’t that wonderful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So there are 3?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Of course there are 3
resurrections. You didn’t know that did you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: No.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And was Jesus one of the 3
or the 4th?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There are only 3
resurrections.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Yes, but Jesus did still
different. He died, then he came back manifested and then he picked up his
body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No, no, no, no. Jesus
died ok right and willingly postponed the picking up of the body to go into
Hades and pick up the cells of the bodies that was left in Hell that was part
of him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Part of Him?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=FR style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=FR style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Adam. </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Was Adam in Hades?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Contained there for
that moment so His Christ&#8209;self could come down and pick up those cells.
This is a wonderful experience to know that you creatures have gotten this
information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So actually there was no
other place to put all those bodies but in Hades?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct. Because the
Gates</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Were closed?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Of Wisdom and Love
and Beauty were closed. Therefore all cells had to be refined in the fire. The
fire was Christ had to go back into His Heart to pick up the cells.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So in reality did Jesus
die of a heart attack on the Cross?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: He died of an explosion
of the heart, in the Cross.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What are the cases of
heart attack that are not as  ?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: All heart attacks are
the beginnings of the 3rd resurrection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Session ?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When Jesus tells the
apostles, that don’t worry, I’m leaving but I’m going to send another comforter
to you, and He is referring to the Holy Spirit, does that mean that the Holy
Spirit wasn’t around before Jesus?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The centers within
the body were not able to hold on to the Flame of Love, which opens up the
centers for wisdom and Christ represents that Love. When He opens that Flame
over the Heart, then the Wisdom in the thyroidcan open and make that able to
see, speak, and hear, and perceive other things beyond.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Would you tell us what
happened to the entity Jesus between the time he died on the cross and when he
resurrected 3 days later?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The entity in
question descended into the earth, crawled through its hole in which was the
residues of lost begone societies and ages continuing from the continents of
Linteus Morinus (?) and Lemurium Lantus Sectus or better into the existence of
the spiritual substance familiarity and constant companions of the spiritual
vibration entity substance coming forth into the planet earth through this cold
metal. In this the genetic structure of the societies and make&#8209;up of the
genes to come would be expedient and explicit in many areas in correspondence
to the spirit forming body substance of now. You would find the society in a
secular and complete system of rejuvenation and revibration of the center souls
within the body today. The structures are familiarly found within the center
and middle sectors of earth, causing a society that would be giants
terminology. The Spirit of Christ went into this world of existence to combat
the forces of the explinted or more&#8209;so the mind aspect, which would be
beyond the mind aspect of the earth, bringing a spirit of Love and
consciousness in the very building substance of its makeup. We would find that
the entity Jesus resided here for a period of a day to two in which he had to
meet special tests and regulations of a spirit nature from a spiritual sense.
Each test requiring a maximum. If the spirit entity or that soul of Jesus would
have failed it would consider the law that when that from above comes down to
meet the test, if failed then the complete changeover of systems and existence
would do a reverse, for the middle to be on top and the top to be the middle.
This was the regulations and all was there at stake. Then the entity Jesus
returned back to earth successful and a new force of energy which would be
rejuvenated through the contact on the earth into the higher realms in which He
then ascended through vehicles to another existence victorious on many levels.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When Jesus traveled to
what is called to get the keys out of hell, did he travel to an actual physical
place?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is that what consider
Middle Earth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you give us a
description of the middle earth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No. The middle earth
is a direct condition of understanding and learning process that would be
entirely upside down from the earth's surface. We already gave you some
descriptions in our sessions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>At the time in which those
who were incarnated into this relation, there are many cellular expeditions in
the galaxies that these entities will and are taking during that which is
called sleep. These expeditions travel to many constellations and what would be
known stellaloid or stellites planetaria! subjects to the rule in which we have
command. There are many forces or what would be called objectnites in which
these objects travel into many galaxies producing by the electrical component
the history and form of that particular solar system. There are at least 15
trillion of such that are traveling through certain galaxies numbering of the
same. We also have the understanding of the circulation of the blood system or
that of the cellular or the structure of the liquid mass that moves through the
organs of each center. Each one representing a part of the outer and interior
motivation of the soul. There are also many what would be called stemites,
again would be stenite in which we would consume that which is unconsumeable.
We have also many forms of law and order that is projected through what would
be named as the ombus&#8209;impus in which would be the law of many of these
stenites and objectites traveling to the speed in which would be 15 trillion
seconds or 15 trillion galaxies of objects. This has been what would be known
as to those who have the ears to hear, to decipher what has just been said. It
is one of the major keys in which I will be giving to you for the understanding
of your own selves and circumstances around. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell us more
about the &quot;stenites&quot; as you called it in a session? You said
&quot;Consume the Unconsumable&quot;?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This all represents
the elements around us. It is very obvious that one might be able to understand
that there are worlds and galaxies invisible to us. That,  that which is
positive that emanates from us can be absorbed immediately, and that which is
negative cannot be absorbed. These elements are always gathered around us: one
to take in and one just to store up. That which is stored up must be met
eventually.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Now Christmas is an aspect of
different universes coming together glowing as bright as they can, of the
actual Love center. It is during Christmas or the season that the Love or the
Heart center vibrates the strongest and that is why Christmas is so magical for
a lot of people. But in Christmas or the First Bethlehem scene man, thousands
of years there was no snow, but there was poverty. There was no war, but there
was negativity and fear and anxiety, and each one had to fulfill in themselves
and summon up the Spirit of Truth inside. When the birth of Christ did happen
there was not much to talk about, a baby was born. But the magical Essence of
around the Child was affected by all those who came near. The Essenes had a
magical way too of protecting the area. But this particular time reflects the
magic of the heart. And we ask that partake in this day to remember the Heart
center and let it glow from you and do your best for what you have.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: With Psalms 111,112,113,
is that a formula for what I think it is?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is a formula of creativity
and for the heart center.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How do you mean the heart
center?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It goes through one
cylinder and out the other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Through one cylinder in
the thymus?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It represents the
cylinder of awareness of life and the presence of the physical changeable atoms
within the body. For remember I give I give you information that all the cells
within the body, before they manifest within the body, are manifested first
within the heart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: All of the cells that are
within the body first begin with the heart?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: All the cells within
the body manifest within the heart and then is projected throughout the body.
Therefore the species as they become what they think and what they think is
what their heart says and in their face is the story of their lives, that their
love center is a reflection of their body, and their body is the reflection of
their love center.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Do I understand correctly
that when the gonad energy is applied correctly, or any time it’s used
spiritually, unselfishly, that it creates new cells in the heart center?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Prayer-Lord, in this hour I
come before you to strengthen my faith. Help me when I am weak to become strong
in the spirit, that my logical mind will not take control, that my spiritual being
will have the ultimate say.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You must understand
people, that your logical mind questions the spirit constantly, that the
logical mind feels it knows all the answers to everything. But how shocked we
are and dismayed to find out that the spirit comes forth and confounds always
the logical mind. So at this point we’re only saying to you: Silence your
logical mind and open up your spiritual essence, your spiritual powers. By
doing so, you can walk on territory that has never been walked on before. So
Silence your logical mind and let your heart open to the spiritual essence of
life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Isn’t there a price for
opening the spiritual side and closing the logical? And what is that price?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forcers- Opening up the
spiritual and closing the logical. Price of evolution of the soul movement
forward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But there is physical
consequences?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, certain cells
within the body are vibrating and they cannot be sowed down once started.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What are those cells?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Those deal with the
stability of the mind, causing a great deal of mental depression and
schizophrenia they call it, manic depressions as they call it; All this
terminology is just the explanation of mind going through its bends and once
vibration starts, should not be stopped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Does also in consequence
slow down other cells as it speeds up these?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It brings the heart
cells into shape and function. When it is terminated, it turns that into fat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could I have a little
better understanding on the last thing you said?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Cells around the
heart vibrate at a certain rate. When one turns away from the spiritual path
the cells that vibrated at certain  rates and stopped turned into fat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What is the physical
origin of aging. In this house we don’t particularly seem to be doing it as
fast as other people?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Combination of the
spirit and the essence of the spirit around you and that of the radiance of a
God force that is within.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So without that something
breaks down inside?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Without the God-Force
the breaking down process is much  rapider.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is there a particular
chemical element that is the main one that breaks down?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You mean the element
which breaks down the aging process readily and faster?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: What do you mean?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: What types of food
would be contributing to the breaking down process of old age?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Well, that too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We would reveal the
foods that would breakdown for old age. Contributing to old age are many
different basics.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What are they?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: First of all: Loving
your neighbor as yourself is a basic. That old age will not penetrate too.
Service is another basic that gives you the health and vitamins the body needs.
Through service it rejuvenates the cells within the body. Strange as it is.
Through such service of giving does the body rejuvenate on an etheric level.
And this is what is meant through giving do you receive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is there also what is
referring to, like a certain type of cell in the body that it breaks down
faster and a factor within the body that it’s a cell a certain particular?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: More so the radiance
around the body that dictates the breaking down of cells faster. When the soul
is on a negative force then the cellular structure of the body break down
faster to old age.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the age process really
is through the aura?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The age process is
through the Heart center. The Heart has a certain enzyme that is secreted
through what we would call the ploratic or the what would be considered the
valves of the Heart into the blood system. These are tiny little what would be
considered glandual pockets, coming from the lymphatic system that in each
valve is this gland that secrets into the blood. When the Heart is negative
these here glands secrets nothing into the blood causing the aging process to
increase. When the Heart is in a positive and giving mode and in that form the
glands secrets the enzyme that what would be considered coats the cell in a
healing pocket of lotion that stops the aging process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The enzyme works-functions
at the cell surface then?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The enzyme through
the blood circulation coats every cell within the body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And how is meditation
helpful to that process?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This makes the enzyme
rapidly grow more and increase the volume and the amount of a producing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The cross and the star of
David is your symbol of service. It is not your chain. It is your radiant mark
and calling to the world of commitment. It is the same symbol that radiates on
an astral level above your heart center when it is in harmony. When your eyes
perceive the symbol, it makes that symbol on an astral level stronger, and when
it is stronger your commitment to your spirit is made whole.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Now in this course of
meditations that you all are undertaking, you must remember that each and every
one of you have your own private ship. In your meditation you are tuning up
this particular ship in which you call it a flying carpet, would one day come
and manifest underneath you and carry the forces away with you. Sounds
interesting, but if done properly people can disappear in meditation, never
coming back. The heart transfers, as in many cases, the heart is a gyro that
moves around and gives momentum and becomes a ship in itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>There are many forces, but
blood is a very precious and a very notable reaction to that of black forces
and white forces. There are some that react when the black forces are so strong
that it is only through the blood system that their protection is developed and
through this blood system the protection is developed to fight off the invading
black forces. In this case their is an outer and inner war going on in which
the blood system must be conquering and would devour that way of the black
forces. It would also cherish that what is within is without.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you give us any
understanding about the new form that we use in meditation now?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is the
contribution of evolution from the beginning of time to the present scientific,
modern Essenes. It is the beginning of the art or the old. For you are all the
Essenes of old. For each one played a different role. This is the new one. If
you ever wanted to name this group, you would say, “ The old way comes again to
be called the new one&quot;. For the ones that would be said, the Followers of
the Word or the Listeners to the Force or the Initiates of the Fifth or The Dan
Munus Sectus. We can continue until the sun rises in the morning. Or you can
call yourselves &quot;A Joke&quot;. It is not what you call yourselves that is
our importance. For many people call themselves many things and do nothing. Do
not seek for what you can call yourselves. For what is this thing? This
ceremony? It is a tuning in to each center of divinity within self, which is
the most beautiful thing for your newly development in this year. A ritual that
brings joy and humor to the heart as well as spiritual insight with your dreams
as you will see it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I was reading last night
in <u>The Aquarian Gospel </u>and it said that the Silent Brotherhood marched
up to Jesus...to the tomb. And when they marched up, the tomb started to glow.
Could you ex­plain that? And what the Silent Brotherhood was? And what they
were doing?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: My dear friend, you
want to know so much, and yet as this entity has spoken to you before he went
into trance, you apply so little. You ask the biggest questions, the secrets of
many, many millenniums, secrets of the universe. And yet you do not even tat
upon your own self the development of your own ABC's. If we have give you the
answer to this particular thing, it will reveal much to you for the
degrandizement or the misuse. In your position at this moment it would be to
the misuse. But it is what you would call that these centers or these forces
around man are ever present. And when tapped upon will illuminate the man
himself. In meditation when entered into with a sincere heart, the forces of
the Brotherhood comes closer and closer into the point where they would
manifest and march before your very eyes and show themselves in a plateau what
hovers above you In this sense, you will be able to commune with them and they
with you as they are being in communion with you always. But you not being
conscious of it makes it more of not understanding that there are no one around
you. But once this contact is made, it illuminates and resurrects your own
earthly body into a higher vibratorial essence of ethers that will bring the
body from the grave of darkness into the light. This can be tapped upon when
one is sincerely entering into meditation and concentrating on the light that
is around him. If done for approximately two minutes to understand the light,
one can tap into the Brotherhood of Mankind. And at that point, when this is
done, one who will speak through as it speaks through us, that this light does
speak for all those who do want to listen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Just remember,  the
White Brotherhood is the force-field of archangels and angels that are
surrounding each individual. For as we have the white forces manifested on a
physical, we have an invisible city on a spiritual level residing. There is a
city residing on this very house. As you meditate you bring this city closer
and closer into manifestation into.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell us more
about the White Brotherhood?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They are a group on a
unit to themselves residing in forest in pine trees. They have a Spirit origin
and reside in certain networks throughout the countries. Certain points of
interest are usually lined with their meetings. Their meetings usually exist on
the 13<sup>th</sup> of the month, when they make their important decisions for
the remainder of that month.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is it something like the
Inner Lodge talked about in the Druid books?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We find them to
represent something along those lines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You say they reside in
forest, you mean they have Astral Cities?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Of course.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Our forest by any chance?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We would like them to
be in our own back yard now won’t we/</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Like the […] was built
there because there was a city in the back yard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Therefore you are
building on top of a North Lenite Lodge or better known as the Southern Cross
Lodge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So we do have a city?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You have one what
would be considered at the base of the amphitheater.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You said their meetings
revolved around points of interest. What did you mean by that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Local and Empire
wise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are they dealing with the
conditions of earth or are they specifically dealing with groups consciousness?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They are dealing with
conditions of the Spiritual level on earth and the souls about to come in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What to us is considered
Death?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You said the city is being
built, its not yet there completed?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: As you complete a
certain segment in the House, they complete a certain segment in the City.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Your in charge of them
right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The water comes
through their stream and it is a major stream and it is their ocean from the
astral city.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Ocean?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: To you its just a
stream.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How is that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Strange things do
happen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are they small people?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We are better than
the small people. Small people are small, they have their own problems. The White
Brotherhood belongs to the Universe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So in that Brotherhood
there are those that mastered, Masters from this whole entire Universe?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That to be yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Like for instance somebody
like Ghandi would be there?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let us say the Spirit
of Ghandi is on his own Brotherhood in India.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So who are the ones here?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Those who are
instrument of creating and forming the institution in America to discipline and
organize the souls to lead them into harmony.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you just describe
the entities, what they may look like if we could see them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Old Man’s
painting is representative of part of a chairman of the Council.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell us of what
rooms that have been completed or worked on what it represents or what is equal
to the day of completeing?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The main kitchen on
the first floor represents the Council room. The main dining room on the main
floor represents the Grand Amphitheater. Your main master-bathroom represents
the cleansing room. Your main den on the ground floor represents the meeting
and controverse and converse and topic rooms. Your Den kitchenette represents
the creative abilities of the Dream World. Your music room represents the
spirit of messages sent to the other galaxies and that should be for the moment.
Where you are at the colonial room on the main floor represents the connections
into the past.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell us what
part the White Brotherhood played in the resurrection of Christ?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Major functions of
moving and directing and traveling different bodies and entities around the
globe for connection of the manifestation of the Purpose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is the entity Tom in
contact with them?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let us say the entity
Tom as you know him is just the reaction of their impulses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You mean to say he’s
connected with them rather than you or how does it work?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let us say that we
are directly involved (with) moving the entity around. But they are directly
involved in getting through into the earth some of their messages in a much
faster degree than normally provided. But they are just taking advantage of the
electrical wire that is there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But its by your approval?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We gave them sanction
to use the (rights).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Does the entity understand
that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You  will find that
the entity will understand very little of what is happening, it is very
confusing. But the White Brotherhood neither expresses nor tells, for in doing
so personalities get involved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is it also something like
I don’t know in electricity how you call it but a station from one point to the
next point, so its easier for you something like to use the White Brotherhood
as a station and there is a booster, they are like a booster?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let us say they are
asking permission for the rights of a line that is in a field of operation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are they using any other
people in this vicinity?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We have the Marble
Palace in the vicinity that you will have a force or field in back of that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You mean another city?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Shenandoah, (     )
moreso known as Shanoah, Swananoah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So they have a city there
to?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let us they have in
back of their place one of the sister cities. What is in back of this place is
called what would be considered a capital of the centers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I see and that place also
(holds up activated)?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That is why the water
is coming through that section.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: At one time you said their
was a cave that connected our house to Swananoah, is that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You understand why we
have just called it the sister city.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was that connected on
purpose or was that a natural fault or was it done on purpose?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Can you tell me anything
about white magic and its relationship to the development we’re undergoing now?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: White magic is just a
terminology of the Laws of God. As simple as that. Those who develop are those
who first come to the awareness of (1) Fear thou God. (2) Love thy neighbor.
(3) Do unto all things as you would have them do unto you. White magic is
incorporated into what I have just given you. To love your God with your whole
heart and your whole mind and your whole soul, and likewise is the precepts of
the law based unto this, to love your neighbor as yourself. If you understand
these precepts, you’d have in your hands the power of white magic. Prayer is
the antidote again and also the by&#8209;product and also the backbone of what
you call white magic. It has been brought into perspective by one who was named
Solomon. The undertaking of mathematical skills, the construction of thought
forms, the destruction of thought forms, the bring into harmony, calling of the
angels of all 12 of them, calling unto all of the forces of the galaxies,
calling of the planets, and the hours and the days and the years for each day
and year and year has that moment of angel that guides it. And we ask that you
come into an agreement within self. White magic is love thyself, too. And if
one can do this he can understand gradually what white magic might truly unfold
to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you...could you tell
me anything more about the Psalms? If through Psalms there is something deeper
like a healing power when they were written?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Psalms are
mystical, magical laws and regulations of every spiritual miracle. It is the
corner&#8209;stone of every miracle that can and will happen. Every seven
Psalms is a mystical, spiritual miracle. Every seven Psalms represents a
physical-elemental, natural law. If going through the Psalms, you take every
seven Psalms, from that point on you will have one law in working-ship and
order.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could I just ask in the
Twenty&#8209;third Psalm, what the rod and the staff means?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The rod and the staff
is life and energy in the kundalini, spiritual substance. Also it means the
measurement in which you must use your own development of consciousness and
under­standing of what you say and how you say it. Man must be constantly
measured every evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you. Also, why is
the  Twenty-third  Psalm the most sacred psalm?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Because it describes
the descent of the soul into the earth and the mastery of the soul out of the
earth with the guidance of God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: With Psalm 24 when it
say’s Lift up yea heads oh yea gates and be lifted up yea everlasting doors and
the King of Glory shall come in&quot;. Could you tell us what happens when
that’s being said?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is a straight
back during meditation, that your pineal and pituitary might be in alignment
and that the doors of Heaven might open up to the other centers of the body. All
gates on the earth represent the gate between the pineal and the pituitary
gland. So where there is a gate made out of iron and wrought rail with points,
it represents that gate within your body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Psalms 120 through 126
this particular set of Psalms?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They are nice Psalms.
They develop the thymus and the thyroid center. Remember again, the thymus, the
thyroid, the Psalms develop each center; some are a set of 7; some are a set of
22.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell us which
ones are a set of 22?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You will find them in
that which is near the end and beginning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Those Psalms 121 to 126, I
believe was given as for the thyroid and the  thymus. Are all of them for the 
thyroid and the thymus?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Of course not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could it be given what the
rest of them are for?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: To help you along
with each passing day, certain particular glands as a different part of that
Psalm. First you have it going from the leyden center to the adrenal, from the
adrenal to the pituitary-pineal, pituitary-pineal to the thyroid, thyroid to
the thymus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: It’s almost like the
Lord’s Prayer then?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In the book I have been
reading on the kabalah. In one part it mentions that the Books written by
Solomon, the Song of Songs that it represents the sephiroth on the Tree of Life
of Beauty and that Proverbs represents the sephiroth of Judgement no
Ecclesiastes represents the sephiroth of Judgement and Proverbs represents the
sephiroth of Loving-Kindness. Would this be accurate?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We find it as such.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: It also says that a tool
that Solomon used was breathing and that whenever it says in Ecclesiastes that
all is vanity, that another translation from the Hebrew means breath and that
what he was saying was all is breath. Implicating that he was using different
breathing techniques along with meditation and along with prayer to invoke the,
to invoke the different sephiroth, the experience of different sephiroth. Would
this be true?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: With the kabala that I'm
reading now a little bit, is that detrimental for me?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: What would be
detrimental is the entity not getting involved with this life process It would
not be detrimental to read this book.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: With the Song of Solomon,
could you tell what that means, in general, the whole book?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It would be simply
the balance between male and female in the natural elements of the earth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So when you read that,
just read that, that's balance?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It would manifest the
balance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When you have that
balance, what does that indicate?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It allows you to move

the woman in the book? What does that represent?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It only represents

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell us all
about the Book Ecclesiastes, who wrote it and all the ins and outs?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, Ecclesiastes is
written for those who got caught in the earth, trying to show them that the
soul is the only salvation for man out of the earth. Who wrote it,  well it. a
combination of many what would be called experienced Prophets. Also it was
influenced by Moses and Aaron, and Aaron being the one who got involved in  the
earth, and Moses who had to go through the pain of the soul. Helped along
spread about by the encounters of the Prophets and lead by Isaiah and given to 
Joshua through Isaiah, then handed down to Solomon, which Solomon  opened up
the information too those who would have to perceive it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The voice of the Speaker
is primarily Aaron or Moses?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No, no, no, the Voice
of the Speaker is primarily the Forces on the mountain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Not exactly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Lets say the Book
serves 3 purposes, ( 1 ) to tell you the past fall of the visitors  of the
earth, who misused their power. (2) told you Moses problem, and (3) it told you
Solomon’s problem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are the giants the ones
that came from outer space?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes. That’s Just the
beginning of that, there’s more to add on to it later on,  couplings we call
it. There’s 82 couplings in all divided by 13 you get what 445, 632 couplings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is that verses to be added

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Daniel, in the Book of
Daniel, three times he’s told that he’s the beloved of God. Three times. None
of the other prophets are told that, not even Ezekiel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is the evolution
of the prophetic state in which it was the thymus center that Daniel
represents, too. Divine Love and mastery of all those around you when this is a
product within one’s life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you explain how when
a person is confronted by something negative in the outer world that stimulates
a desire within, how this operates through the body, like its automatic and
without thought. Does it operate through the Leiden or?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Operates through the
Leiden, the adrenals, gonads, thymus, and then the question of what would be
happening as the test? If the test is confronted with and corrected and done
right, then it travels upward. If it fails, then it goes to the gonads.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the key is in the
Leiden in controlling the...?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The key is very
definitely in the Leiden center, but then again in the thymus also.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How does the thymus?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The thymus is the
Love of God first. Without that all is failure. That&quot;s why it says without
love, everything is nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In the book
&quot;Initiation&quot; which talks about….?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Comes the House that
you have here represents the pineal gland of Virginia. So it is only fitting
that you light it up. It is in the shape of the pineal gland; in its complete
acreage, and in its complete shape, the pineal gland is in totally representa­tion
of the structure of this house, and all that it is accomplishing. It has been

her spinal, column, from where her true self radiated. Could you tell us
anything about that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In the book
&quot;Initiation and her consciousness falls into her body.....</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: What you are talking
about right here is the Tiphereth, Zohar tree of life, in which man, if he
meditates, communicates the bridge between his higher self. There is a time
when the higher self does take over the body. If you ever had an experience, an
accident, or fall, in that short moment of time, there elapse what we call a
&quot;stalibium deleva&quot; or warp time warp. There the higher self takes
over and slows down time itself: so that it might prevent a serious happening
to its vehicle. The higher self has full control, total control of the earth.
If one allow his higher self, or her higher self to come into the body. When a
person is suffering, this severe accident, or pain, or inflict the higher self
takes command level its shock. The higher level is the higher self, which for
that moment allows the individual to see all that transpire slowly, not caring,
but in the state of elation, of complacence, or quiet joy, peace, knowing that
the body is about to be harmed, but yet, giving it up that it transforms itself
from the physical body into the spiritual nature, allowing the graces and the
benefit to carry the body vehicle from danger. There we try many time. You must
understand that in our imagination we either go after the things we would like,
and in so doing, we justify our desires. . . in so doing we condemn our­selves
to our own torture, that we need not have to suffer. It is easier to quietly
get the bridge between the higher self into the lower conscious mind that you
are aware of as you, your smaller ego. It is the ego that fights the higher
self recogni­tion...the same with Jacob and Esau. Jacob represents the
spiritual mind, and Esau the physical desires. As you all know Jacob grabbed a
hold of Esau's heel and because of that had control of the physical desires. No
matter how much man tries and strug­gles to run from God and spiritual ideals,
God, the higher force the spirit has already fixed the game, a game started by
santanic beelzebub, lucifer, the Higher Forces had entered into a pact, but the
pact was entered into with a stack of cards from the force of God. God does not
make a deal when it is not for him. When we deviate our creative abilities to
our desires, of course we send out notes and sound. Its like a seal. A seal
sends out sounds in the water constantly so other porpoises or seals might hear
it, and it is a very high pitched sound, that sounds (sound similar to those
recorded by underwater mikes)higher than that of course, but those are your first
3 notes that send out that of &quot;are you there, and human beings are the
same way. They send out high pitched sounds to &quot;are you there, and other
human beings who are on the same frequency, pickup these notes. Now, what are
we talking about. How did we get involved in such a complex answer to a most
relevant and simple question. The answer is,...the question is complex in
nature and deserves a complete and accurate reply. We, everyday, through the
course of our prayers, and Meditations set up a force field around us, by the
voice, structure of sound thought patterns of thoughts, actions, body
movements, and eye contact. In all these unequivacable experiences we are a
walking orchestra, and each part sends out a note, a beat, a rhythm, and the
rhythm is felt, and the chord is known, and the word is given; so, when we
attract situations to us, it is not those around us, but it is rather that
which is within self that attracts it; so when you are speaking about this
revelation, or this happening, it is the attunement with the higher self that
has complete control over you. Now we got to face some facts each end every one
of you have, what we would call a higher self. This higher self is devoid of
all emotions. It does not have emotional feelings. It can give you punishment,
and it can give you grace without any emotional attachment. I am not saying
that it does not care for you, but it does know what you need, and it will find
the force and thought to give you it, what you need. Of course, your ego has to
put up with it and suffer it. Also it can benefit by it and flow by it if it
sets itself up in the right rhythm daily, by prayer and meditation. The words
you pray are words filtering the body’s force fields in harmony with the music
of the spheres. So each prayer that is said or read is a part of the system of
the glands that are being worked with and put into harmony, on an invisible
level so that creation can be done. Therefore when felt in the spinal area,
sensations or feelings or enlightenment as might be known by those who have
gone onto the path of soul or searching, then this would be the out-come.
Enlightenment of the soul in the physical body, by revelation. This is a normal
process, that the higher self puts into order, and at times of stress, and exertion,
of work, of anticipation of bodily harm, the higher forces come in, or the
higher self, and this is called the time warp. Does that help you?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>We have given you the answer.
We have so many smart people. But when it comes to their own they’re stupid.
They perceive answers for others, but for themselves they perceive slowly. If
they could only be as accurate with others as they are. They should also be
just as accurate with themselves. It would not be explainable at this moment.
We give certain things so the entities will work for them. Do not make it so
easy for yourselves. For we can make it more complicated if you pretend to be
as smart as you are. There is a force that rises underneath that of the energy
in which is by x&#8209;2&#8209;7&#8209;6&#8209;1&#8209;0 . By this force you
would find the interesting factor in the leyden center that is connected to the
pineal center. This center when manifested correctly will give you the
undertaking of your purpose here on the earth. Figure that one. And I give you
the name Ishavel as your key.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That is exactly what
it says. The over-self is your Higher Self that knows your plans that must be
done here on the earth. The higher God or the deity is busy as you might say
keeping the over-selves together with the lower selves. The lower selves are
busy running away from' the over-selves. Every self is running away from other
selves. There are so many selves that I don't know what is going to happen with
the over-selves. All it means is that the lower selves can and should
communicate to their higher selves. So your higher selves can say to the deity
that we are in control.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Well, how do you pray so
that the lower self can communicate to the higher self?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You do not say
&quot;Higher Self, Higher Self, here I say, Higher Self.&quot; Do not have this
concept in your mind. Just project to your Higher Self and know that it is
within your reach. Do not project and say, &quot;Where is my Higher Self? Where
is my Over-self? Over-self, Over-self, I am talking to you. You have no con­cept
of who you are talking to, but you are talking to God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Excerpt on Prayer and the
Rosary. <br>
<br>
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>They go to a storehouse of
energy that is pelted down into the earth. For remember, it is not our prayers
that is from us. It is your prayer that is from you. You send it up we only
send it back down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So actually it is not bad
to pray for specific things?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct. That is why
the rosary that you have is a very powerful instrument. You do know the power
that you have in those little wooden beads. Simple. Use them correctly and no
one, need we say more. The power is right in front of you all the time. Hum.
You just wanted to do it yourselves. But it was right there all the time. Do yet
understand at this point in time why this woman of God is yet so powerful. She
holds the crystal in her hand. But remember, the prayers of many souls before
were sent to this woman. Now look how much energy you have if you continue to
send with the force in back of it. The request is not a request, it is a
intercession. Never make a direct request. But always make an intercession for
help.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How do you do that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You just ask for a
direct request. Then your Father knows your request even by your not saying it.
Even before you pray, your Father which is in heaven knows your request. Prayer
is your weapon, use it. Prayer is your spear, drive it. Prayer is your shield,
use it. Prayer is your power, don’t abuse it. Put that to a song and use it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you give us some
more information about the rosary, its history?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The rosary is used as
a force in which raises the spiritual 144,000 cells in the body. It is a
combination of ethics, principles, and philosophies across the whole continent
of the earth. There are many galaxies and star&#8209;stellite systems that are
used and is in combination with the design of the rosary. If you would look
closely, a solar system is derived in that shape of a rosary. Rosaries or that
of beads are used for conscious object in stirring up the healing energy forces
from the lower centers to give power of light and healing to those who say it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you explain the
force that rises through the rosary when we do it as a group?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let us say it is a
force of energy that is raises for many years and lifetimes ago. More like the
force of energy that turns the earth around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In Ecclesiastes when it
says that God put the world in man’s Heart. Is that the part of the Heart
that’s evil?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is the rotation of
the earth’s axis that the electrical impulses of the heart are (running?).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Would you describe in
detail what happened when the rosary was received into the earth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That the rosary was
transported on an astral level to this particular person. He in respect was
receptive to the astral spirit, in which the Madonna as she is called manifest
herself. And in so doing you have a story of St. Dominic who received this
particular rosary. And he was also receptive to certain answers within. This
particular rosary if used rightly can cast away all evil force and replenish
this certain 4th center of the nervous system properly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Can you tell me, in the
meditation room sometimes when we say the rosary, I feel a presence after a
certain point, It feels like a spring cool water. What is this presence?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The presence is a
guide over the rosary,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is that Mary?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is some aspect of
Andrew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Andrew?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct. Question,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Can you tell us why Saint
Andrew is the guide over the rosary?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Because the road
forms and the basic beliefs of this strong individual affects a ... of all
kinds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Its like building a is
that the way you would build anything</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>that in the rosary
repetition?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is a couplet. In
this you would find the secret of the word. You’d find the word and find the
meaning couplet. You’d find the answer to this particular system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Would you tell us at this
time how many other places besides Japan that Jesus manifested when he was
crucified?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We would say a large
amount of times over that of fifteen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was Jesus crucified
anywhere else besides in Israel?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Master was
crucified in Israel, or what would be known, near Jerusalem. The repercussions
on the spiritual and astral level were at least 15 other distinct places,
representing the 15 major nervous points within the body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I want to ask something
about the statue of Michael, is it the same thing […] sees as he’s killing that
thing in the heart?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is depicted a
little bit more in detail. The wings are a little bit larger, and the face and
eyes are stronger, the sword is up, but this depicts a different era. Now the
sword is up, but this depicts the sword being down. It is not wrong, it is only
an expression of time for the sword to go down. But now the sword is up, ready
to come down. This is the finer depiction, or that of the finer outcome, in
which the sword shall go down. It is not bad, not far from accurate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Does it represent the thing
at the heart?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Close to the
proximity of.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: It represents Michael
killing the blob?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: What a horrible name,
blob and Archangel Michael.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Well what’s the name of it
then?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Blob, what name you
give it, call it Excalibar, call it Rock of Hades, Call it the Noise, Call it
whatever. It does communicate a thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And its based in the
Heart?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It would be settled
on that point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When did it originate in
mankind?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: As man developed in
the earth, so did this develop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: It was over a period of
time?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is there a connection
between the nervous system and the tentacles of the blob?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There is a direct
connection between the nervous system and the blob. Our desires. Remember, the
blob as you call it is seated over the heart and gets energy from the gonads
misuse and misapplication and represents Judas who fell away from the
apostle-ship of Jesus. Represents misuse of your energy and must regain
commitment to your God. It is connected through the nervous system and in such
a manner that it is throughout the whole system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: It reaches to everything
in the body?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Negative field
reaches out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What does the blob have to
do with moon day?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That is the force
that tries to take over the back section of the center brain. This is the
battle that is confronted by moon day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you explain how when
a person is confronted by something negative in the outer world that stimulates
a desire within, how this operates through the body, like its automatic and
without thought. Does it operate through the Leiden or?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Operates through the
Leiden, the adrenals, gonads, thymus, and then the question of what would be
happening as the test? If the test is confronted with and corrected and done
right, then it travels upward. If it fails, then it goes to the gonads.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the key is in the
Leiden in controlling the...?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The key is very
definitely in the Leiden center, but then again in the thymus also.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How does the thymus?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The thymus is the Love
of God first. Without that all is failure. That&quot;s why it says without
love, everything is nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When they built Solomon’s
Temple did they use the power of, did they manifest things in it. They say
there wasn’t the sound of a hammer?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They used instruments
that were not of a hammer nature, more of a thought process of using pressure
versus pressure. A stone versus the pressure of the other stone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What were the tools for
architecture that were used in Ancient Egypt?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: : In one respect:
they have a screen and project the pattern onto the screen, then the screen
projects it onto the sky, and they build in the area where the projection is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: They did it then by
thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct. With prayer
and surrounding yourself with thoughts of the item you are going to create,
then you will have no problems from that point on. Praying is the only reason
why you have complications: forgetting to pray over the work, and asking to be
done should be done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: These old masters that
created all these styles and designs that’s how they did it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The master is the key
expression of the soul. Each design is a certain expression of the soul that
you call upon to come into the house to help guide the souls. This master is a
spirit master.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I see. It's only a
reflection to the worldly level?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces:            What they
would see.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You mean that a prayer
becomes an actual entity working itself sort of out and that's the prayer
finally manifested?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What does the phrase the
Strong Paw of a Lion mean in regard to what actually resurrected the Builder
Hiram?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Strong Paw of a
Lion is the Foundation of the Laws of other lifetimes imprinted upon the
conscious and subconscious and psyche of the soul, which by no mistake can be
released or taken from the bonds of commitment (which) the soul must accomplish
in that particular lifetime. Going back to this Strong Paw of the Lion it also
represents the laws of the government that must follow its manifest destiny.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In regard to that question
about Hiram,  does it mean that a person like the High Priest, it was then or
the very High Priest or whatever, but a person who Knows the soul can resurrect
if they accidentally leave or if something happened and they die that person can
call a soul back just by reminding him of his original commitment before it
came in?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Strange as it is
that’s true and there are messages imprinted in the etheric body of certain
plants that were used by the magicians in Egypt and developed through Europe.
Of course your biggest metaphysical development with flowers of implanting that
of the spiritual purpose of this law dealt especially with Holland. When they,
the occultist realized that in the Tulip was this law and when you would grow
Tulips they would manifest the law protection and the law of , of growth and
spirit. So they started to plant the Tulip bulb and they realized in order to
maintain and save Holland from being taken into the unseen world, which would
they knew as time would progress, that the water would claim it back into the
ethers, but if they would always maintain Tulips on the land, the land would
never sink and this was the big commitment with the angel of the law of
commitment with the laws of the Etheric Flowers. In fact flowers strange as it
is are the laws that have been captured in them. And this is the great
fascination with flowers to people today without them realizing it, but in the
flower world is the different ah laws ah from the beginning of time pressed
over them so man would be reminded of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Remember in order to build a
structure Solomon had to get dedicated people. Dedicated people were those who
for a period of time left their homes and left their conditions and moved and
joined into like a club in which they would meditate and, not that the word
meditate, but they would center their thoughts on prayer and align themselves
so they would be properly, in a proper mold of expression, remember to build
wood and shapes and sizes must be the inner centers have to be or at least
strive to be in the light, right alignment. When this is so then everything
comes out of the hand perfectly. You understand the old saying that whatever he
touches turns to gold. Well this means that the inner centers are from other
lifetimes aligned and its up to that particular entity to use the power now
this lifetime for a positive effect. Of course it could be used negatively. But
remember when the great cathedrals were built all those masonaries and and and
groups of people were in a secret order that made them prepare their minds for
the structure and for the work that they had to do. So remember it doesn’t that
to build a house you have to be completely worldly. To build the perfect house
you have to be completely dedicated, dedicated to that experience of mind
power, because the mind wars against the spirit and when a line is straight or
when a line forms a perfected piece and then the mind tries to sift and tries
to send you in a different direction. If you can only see this wisdom that we
give you now, that a perfect home or a house that has harmony in it is that it
communicates the spiritual law factor of be yea perfect or the spiritual factor
of peace in the earth. So in short you are still glorifying God in the lines
and the work that you do here, even though those who will walk around and try
to say why do you work so hard, they are just seeing they coming short in their
own lives, where they should be doing and manifesting the spirit if they only
put all that energy instead of running around and conversing in all sorts of
excuses to use that energy and build from the earth up, to glorify God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>When You are constructing in
a house, any particular house, you are demanding and dealing with spirit force
and energy. The spirits have construction of wanting to express their sphere of
energy. The force has their expression of lines and shapes, and dimension and
energy works through both. In the secrets of construction, you are more like
building from the fourth dimension into the third dimension. This in itself can
be very tedious, very pressurizing, and very stressing. Any individual who is
termed an architect or a builder, in short, is that conscious creation of
bringing always from the fourth dimension into the third sphere. Builders and
architects in this dimension are known as doctors. These doctors bring and
manifest the spiritual world, that three dimensional level, more permanently
than ever could be realized. The expression and formation of solid objects only
takes their shape and position after the thinking process of the objects and
the thought process of finer qualities have been sifted and received around the
entity area or areas of communication. Surrounding oneself with finer qualities
is not the process of moving out just to do it. It is the process of the
faculties and the expression of discipline throughout the entity life.
Therefore, when you receive or ask the question &quot;how come you do not
receive?&quot; it is not the question &quot;how come you do not receive?'' The
answer is the expression and the giving out of what is received into the third
dimension, for You perceive on the fourth dimension invisible level, but it
takes co&#8209;workers and masters of the spirit to bring it forth from the
fourth dimension what You see into the third dimension. These or those who do
or are interpreters of your vision receive, what would be considered, a growing
process of communicating themselves directly with the fourth dimension. So, in
reality, anyone who builds or constructs a large edifice is tapping into the
fourth dimension. Anyone who builds with a constructive mind with expression
for the spirit taps deeper into the fourth dimension, in which the Angelic or
Angel force comes and lends a hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is the illusion of

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How does this work?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The guy from Russia talks
about using the pineal gland in sort of an electric setup. Why the pineal
gland?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Because it has
certain electrical stimulus within it. Its connection directly into the blood
systems and the nervous cord. But through the pineal gland you can supply the
whole course of the functions of the body. In fact you could take the whole
brain out, but leave that and the other part of the lower sector of the brain and
it would function. The continuum. It would not be able to function as you and
I, but it would at least continue to grow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Would that be a more
spiritual being?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well we didn’t say it
was, anything that’s kept in a jar over 48hrs has a tendency of not being
spiritual. It smells. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: That arrangement of
neurons, does that make it able to perceive the psychic realms beyond the
physical.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, yes. At this
point it is through the pineal gland that they will find that the blood
components are made of. The blood components are rejuvenated within the pineal
gland, to give stimuli in order to flow and the process of flowing. So the
pineal gland has a great percentage of strength in it. Also in the pineal gland
you will have your factor of blood factors which is developed and which it
starts from. Jesus factor in the pineal gland was a complete A, a complete B
personality. So He was AB blood&#8209;type.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is that the connection

top?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: But remember the
pineal is first, the pituitary is second. But at birth the pinea1 is growth.
But at birth the pituitary takes first, but then the pineal takes over and then
the pituitary takes over from that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But which one is the front
lobe here on the forehead?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: For again the
pituitary becomes the front lobe in the beginning, but then moves on back, to
make the pineal move in that position.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So lets say after 18, what
would be here, the pineal or the pituitary?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well it a cycle,
would you believe it or not, every 7 years cycle the pituitary moves back and
the pineal moves forward and visa versa.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And from birth on you
start counting 7 years, every 7 years?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well of course you
can’t start from before you were conceived.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But which one is the one
without sin, is it the pituitary or the pineal?</span></p>

without sin).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Do each of the cards of
the major arcane of the Tarot deck represent a person in the five books of
Moses?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Torah? Tarot? Each
represents a quality in the physical body of man growing into the spiritual and
mental bodies. Different concepts involve different developments. You should
pursue this with thorough investigation and psychic perception.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is Revelation ...are the
chapters marked off correctly as they are now?</span></p>

Tarot card from one to twenty two?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is an aspect
that would added to the aspect of that of developing finished products. It
would develop the one to twenty-two aspect but under a different light field.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: On the Tarot Cards, the 22
major cards. It was said before that there are 22 galaxies. Are these cards
like you visualize each one, you go into that particular galaxy?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Each particular
galaxy in the 22 series represents a finite being of development and
experience. Each particular galaxy makes up a series of lessons and groups of
learning ability. And each has its potential of its own development and spheres
of expression. There are those 22 major forces in these galaxies that has a
strong connection with the pattern of the names. None the less these particular
cards you do mention connect nicely, put into the order it would prescribe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Session 74</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>July 9, 1975 </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Can you give us any of the
history of why the Tarot was first made?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It was made for the
persecutions of what would be called the priests of Egypt, more so of Atlantis.
When the persecution began with that of, we would say the four major kings of
Atlantis or five major kings of Atlantis joining together, then the war started
the breaking apart. Then the secrets of the spiritual world had to be preserved
and was put in metal tablets, carved in metal tablets, then transferred over to
Egypt and the Yucatan, and buried, as you all know, in the right sphinx paw and
in the box of one of the steps leading up the many pyramids in the Yucatan. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How did the cards come
from that...how did resurface . . .? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They really did not
resurface into the public until recently, but they were always around in the
royalty in the high courts. They were always involved with those who were
leading governments, but they were not officially as much as they are today and
never before involved with the public.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How come Archangel Michael
is my favorite Archangel and which Tarot card is representative of me?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We could say
temperance. Favorite because he is strong. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What does the Tarot card
Strength represent?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is the inner
power realization of matter around. Matter from a different focus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What sort of matter?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: More organic and less
physical elements of matter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was there a Tarot card in
reference to working things out in a dream level or getting your answers
through the dreams?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There is the card of
the wands from the clouds that could be interpreted this way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Would the suits in the
Tarot cards, you have one called the Hearts. Does this go along with the thymus
center? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Of course this goes
directly along with it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And the swords what would
that be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The sword is what
would be the solar plexus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And the wand?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The wand is what
would be called the thyroid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And the Pentacles?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The pentacles is the
balance between the leyden center.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The leyden and the gonad?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Just the leyden.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the gonads wouldn’t be
in there?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: No, we have them
placed at their own workings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How would they be working
in the Tarot?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: These really worked
within the Key Master cards. Some of the Key Master cards, as the Searcher and
the other factors of knights (nights) ?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The Searcher, the Seeker
you mean?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What is the meaning of the
following Tarot cards: The High Priestess. . . should I continue?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This represents the
quality within those who are on the path of enlightenment and the certain
qualities of judgement and wisdom mixed within the book of learning and the
structure and understanding of that power in all that they do. It is in the
qualities of the females who usually lies the spiritual powers adequately.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You mentioned in the last
session that in the Tarot the World is to be placed where the Lovers are. Does
that mean that all the other cards go down in order, or are any of the others
switched?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Lovers are the
aspect of male-female within self. Not a physical, worldly sex concept of love,
of male female family type aspect of lovey-dovey. Love is within self first.
Loving thyself, that is loving the qualities of male female and understanding
them. Many so often approach love with a demented form of expression. When that
is not fulfilled, there is much frustration and detriment to the soul, body,
and mind. In the relationship of love, it is never a taking and or satisfying
and of saying &quot;My husband should serve me&quot; and My wife should give
me&quot;. It is always a giving of the other partner, never what one should
want. For when one goes into marriage saying &quot; If you love me, you will do
this, this, and this&quot;, then  that marriage is on the wrong course and
should be changed. Yes, all cards are subjected to Love, but so is the
Universe. That does not make the cards any less thereafter that follow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So does the Hebrew letters
change?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Hebrew letters of
the world never change. From the foundation of time, they were created. There
is no change with the Hebrew form.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In Chronicles one you said
we could find all the court cards?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What part of it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: 10th chapter, 10th
verse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In the Tarot we are
working on, showed me the kings, are they correct?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We would find them to
be, yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And all the pages, are
they correct, except the one for water?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What would be the page for
water?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We would find that to
be more of a carrying of a pitcher.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Would it be a person in the
Bible picture?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We would more-so find
that to be the Ark of Noah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So that would be the page?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The four ace cards, they
go by themselves like Trumps?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Like the four elements?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Then there are 36 left
over and they correspond to the 36 righteous men and form the pattern like in
the Book of Solomon?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You could do that.
Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: On the Tarot,[…] was
discussing between sessions about the 36 minor prophets, is that correct?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When you speak of the 4
suits like in the Tarot, does that relate to the Torah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It would relate to
this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: It would be eliminating
Genesis. It would relate to the other 4 books?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It could establish
itself in all 5 books of Moses, including the 3 books are forgotten.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What were those books?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They’re forgotten.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What happened to them?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: When man turns away
from the spiritual force of life, the laws of Moses and the originality is
taken away from him. For him to crope and stroff in the stones of the earth and
start from the beginning of, remember only what you put into the spirit do you
retain and get out of the spirit. You can not fake it. Either you put into the
spirit and you shall take from the spirit. Or you put not into the spirit and
you take not from the spirit. You can only take so much from the earth and then
it is stagnant. Seeds must be planted into the earth to have a rebirth. Rebirth
is the function of the soul within the body to rekindle back in the earth from
the beginning of time, the spirit of wisdom. Mark yea the steps forward, each
one in a cell, A to Z, Aleph to Beth, all things from the beginning has a
purpose. All work has a cabalistic number. Remember this, you cannot start with
Gimel. You can’t start with ?(The). You must start from the beginning of the
force and through each step on a occult level go through. No matter how much
you want to get to the end of the alphabet, you will not progress through it by
violating the occult law of step line and step. Remember every step, every
deed, every task, every force must be followed by a system of choice, must be
followed by a system of voice, for voice within you will guide you through it.
Each step must be honored and each step must be respected. If you force, if you
fudge, if you cheat, the steps will reveal you the quality of the cheater. So
the occult law is everything is matched perfectly and you being perfect will be
the perfector.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: On the 8 Books of Moses,
the last time you told me they were 3 elements like in the blood. Do I
understand Sulphur, Mercury, and Salt of the Alchemist?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I still get the feeling
there are 3 books.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Where are they located?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=FR style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Spain,
Portugal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell what the
Hebrew letters are and where they came from?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: (What sounds like a
sneeze comes forth) That is how it was developed. By the breath of God, they
exploded into the atmosphere and the sound became the drive and the power
became the Word. Each sound was the expression of the gods.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was that correct about the
dream I had with the alphabet letters and the code, the blue?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The alphabet and the
letters and the code should be undertaken which would be called the fourth
center within the body. The alphabet is the leading of that which is called the
psychomat or that of the nervous system. In other words, to put it on a simpler
term, you must learn how to be A.) Comfortable with your self; B.) Patient with
yourself; C.)  Apply this particular dream as communication to you that you must
go through the alphabet or the ABC's of Patience. In order to get to Z. you
must go through the other centers and other development sides of development of
these characteristic letters. The blue represents that of tranquility that
would be only yours when patience is applied and faith is under­taken to the
course in which you must follow. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you. Is there
anything else that we could learn about the...about the way the alphabet
corresponds with the musical notes?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: A, B. C, D, E, F. G.
There’s your notes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is it correct that the
Kabala, say for instance, or all of the mystic...mystic books and the Bible can
be played by assigning a letter of the alphabet to a letter on the keyboard?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This could be done in
an accurate fashion, causing a great deal of harmony for all those who wish to
learn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Would the first eight
letters correspond exactly to the keyboard, &quot;A&quot; through
&quot;G&quot;?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It could be made out
to be this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Would there be a better
way?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is the best.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And following that, the
letter &quot;H&quot; would begin again with the letter, with the key

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Can it be given?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yeah! See why not.
Take your alphabet the first 5 would be the radiance of Michael. And then from
there you have it separate into 3 slots: each with a section of 3 times and
that would be that of Gabriel, Raphael, and Auriel in or Oil, Auriel yeah Oil
in charge of . They’ll be work with that. Then that will give you 4 more slots
of 5, 2, 3 minus of course 2. Of course you will have to do some figuring on
this, but it should come out that the next ones would be the Raphael, Auriel
again, but Raphael, Auriel and a Gabriel and Zekiel in all of these higher
echelons. So that’s your major trumps. Then you have your minor angels or
archangels that come into play on each individual letter. So with that, that
should be for the moment and then you could work out the other angels as time
goes on</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you explain how the
42 letters connect with the 22?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They connect in the
point of the upper and lower spheres. The upper ones being the 42 and the lower
ones being the 22. A diamond shape intererating into a square force and pocket
soil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you give how the 42
letters connect with the 42 1etters, like certain ones go with like two letters
from above go with one letter from below?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, one from above,
one on top of the above and one from below. Before anything from above can ever
come down, they are two, when they come down they become one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So one then it comes down
to one, then it comes down to the last one?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Then it might break
up to two again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And these correspond to
the precepts?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Like the male&#8209;female
coming down as one, could not make it broke up to two. At the rate they’re
going they will make three or four out of it. I wouldn’t  be a bit surprised in
your civilization to come there will be species that will be three or four.
Male&#8209;female, neuter&#8209;male, neuter&#8209;female.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I’ve been working with the
squares, so far I’ve got with the higher letters a square of 7, for the lower
letters a square of 5. It doesn’t feel to be right. Could you help me with
these?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Lets have the last
lines back again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: For the lower letters I
have a square of 5?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

7.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, alright.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is it the right way?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes it could be
utilized this way, yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is this the way you were
referring to when you gave it to me before?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, not directly as
I just gave it too you before, but this particular method has some improvement
on it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What was the way you gave
it to me before?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: More or less taking
it from the lower sphere of the 14 and working on up to 22.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Do I understand now what
you were saying before, the way I understand it now is that from below the 42 3
times 14?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Go through the 22 which
are the key links?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

42.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=FR style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Uh, huh yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So you have the square of
7 above and the square of 7 below?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Ok.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is that the right way?</span></p>

yes, you will yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: On the diagram I was
talking to Tom about you have the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>higher letters and in the
middle, the middle letters and then the lower letters. Do these go in sequence
taking out the aleph and you take the next 7 letters for the higher letters?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: These would follow in
sequence and would continue a pattern of 42 patterns.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The second 7 symbolize the
center of the diagram?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is true creating
17 to 21 pattern.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Do I understand the
letters again, that the first 7 letters of the Hebrew alphabet would be the
stations of the cross, the next 7 would be the precepts, and the last 7 would
be the aspects of the Beard?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Alright that does
very well, yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: 42 letters above embracing
27 letters below. Not enough higher letters?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There are some
letters that are involved or absorbed in transforming.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Lower letters are the
same?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Lower letters same as
lower some higher.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How absorbed?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They are absorbed in
a lower form and then transformed into a higher form.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What is the sum of the
lower letters and the higher letters?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Sum of each 14 to the
lower letters absorbed to 23 of the higher letters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: 5 letters left over?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The 5 are the Key
letters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I thought 14 was the
higher letters?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: 14 becomes the lower
letters which will be transformed into the higher letters, as they become the
higher letters they maintain the 14 qualities as the higher letters, but then
transformed into the highest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Higher and lower and
connected in between?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A . Twenty two is your key
figure balance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The 14 letters as they
relate to the 22. Do I understand it aright that the first 14 letters of the 42
letters, as they relate to the 22, the first 14 letters go with the first 7
letters of the alphabet and the next 14 go with the next 7 and the next 14 go
with the last 7?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is understood
right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could anymore be given on
that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Each letter is
interconnected with the one preceding it that it would be in the form of the
double square. That it forms a pattern of force used in the right way it
manifests a strong quality of growing and development. In that field of growing
comes a new awareness and new sorts of plans and Revelations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you explain what the
double squares are?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The double squares is
that of above and below.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The double squares that we
talking about the other day, do they relate to the cube of 3 that I have been
studying?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The double squares
relate to the number(s), the higher and lower. More practically involved with
the earth consciousness and they involved with the wisdom’s and pillars of
wisdom and beauty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: About the letters you said
last time that the application of it was not understood. Could you explain a
little bit about that, the application of the letters and the numbers?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Numbers and letters
can only be understood as experiencing of time presence and movement. As you
move through the space and items related you will find that the awareness
factor of each letter and number is what the entity is going through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The higher letters
themselves they don’t ever change do they?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They are stabilized.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And the lower letters they
are the same as the higher letters, its a reflection?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: They are more what
would be called flexible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And you said in between
them is what we know as the Hebrew letters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: These are the ones
that would be considered like (mercury), moving back and forth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And are their some below
those as a reflection of the higher?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We would have some
but not as much.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In the first six chapters
of Genesis, do I understand the fourteen higher letters unite with the
twenty-eight lower letters?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This is a correct
calculation.</span></p>

Book of Numbers would be a digital book.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What does it mean the two
sons of Moses makes the Book of Numbers a digital book.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Many different forms
of Kabala, by writing down the Hebrew or the Aramaic or the numbers or names in
the language of Hebrew they disguised the numbers of the item between the black
ink mark, the ink mark of the Hebrew letter you could see. It is between that
and the next letter forms the digit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is there anything you can
help me to understand the digits you were talking about.</span></p>

tell which is which?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There is a way. You
take every 6-th line and see what’s being said. If it sounds like the 1-st line
of the 6-th, then it’s metaphoric. But if the 6-th line does not correspond to
the 1-st line, then its literal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Should it be like continuous,
like regardless of chapter or should it be like each chapter, the 6-th line.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In the order given in
Genesis?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The order given is
different from this order in Daniel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What would it be in Daniel?
What order would it be in?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: – From the first to
the last.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Reverse order?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We would find the
smallest one to the largest one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is there a relationship
between the twelve sons of Jacob and the twelve disciples?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is a close&#8209;knit
relationship and pattern of development through the eons of time. Each one
representing the physical body, the mental body, and the spiritual body. Each
one representing a certain segment upon the earth, and each one representing a
center within the body. Each one representing the development outside the
sphere of galaxies. Each one representing a galaxy. Each one representing a
part of the Elohim or the Divine Name of God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is there a specific Psalm
for each one of the twelve tribes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: As what has been
said, Psalms what would be known as 90, 91, 92, and 93 for the first 3 sons of
Jacob. 18, 19, 20, 21 for the next 3 sons of Jacob. 54, 55, 56, 57 for the next
3 sons. 100, 101, 102, 103 for the next 3 sons. There will give you a pattern
and a story that would be take that of time and energy to reveal to you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: (..) It was given Psalms
for the tribes or for the brothers and it was said like certain Psalms for the
first 3 and second 3 and so on. Does that mean the order, where it says first 3
or second 3, does it mean the order in which they appear in Jacobs blessing or
in the order in which it shows them as being conceived?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: More of the
conceiving or the receiving of it</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is the information, in
particular the chart in the green book on color accurate?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It would divide the
colors into three spectrums in­stead of what would be called spectrums given at
that moment. That would be called the light color red, which would be pink&#8209;red.
And the dark one, which would be more like red&#8209;orange. All colors are of
three. Even in the zodiac there are three forces. The middle force is the
strongest of all of them. It is a combination of the forces most culminate,
which would be called unison or most in harmony of that element.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Would James and John, the
apostles be represented by Leo and Virgo?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And Mars and Venus?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The part that I read from
the Bible tonight in Numbers, why did they all offer the same gift in the
dedication of the altar and then, and the order in which the tribes went to
offer the gift. Does that relate to the tribes and the meanings that we are
studying now?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It also represents
the centers that must be developed first. The sacrificing and the tribes
spiritualization of these changing centers that must be developed first. If
reviewing this one more time as a key system, you will review not only of the
centers in your body, but also the earthly centers of nations that must be
spiritualized, and also that which is to come.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And the gonads?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That would be a
migration of South America and that part of Africa in different sections.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How would things have gone
differently if the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the tribe of Manasseh had not
decided in the past to stay on the other side of the Jordan?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: These particular
tribe, they represent the element within man that he would not have a physical
body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Striving to get away from

changed for the Israeli Nation on a physical level had they come over also
instead of them staying on the other side?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: What we are saying
for the third time, mankind would not have a physical body, they would be
Etheric and the Nation of Israel would be the Etheric Nation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You’re saying that the
Nation of Israel will be the Etheric nation, it’s still going to happen, just
at a different time?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is going to
happen, the people of Israel will defeat and destroy the Soviet Union
completely, at that point the Ether quality of mankind will develop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The Book of Joshua, what
does that represent?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The crossing over
into the Promised Land or taking upon responsibilities of the spiritual self.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Does it also have to do
with the resurrection of the body?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This would be the
resurrection of the spiritual centers within the body. Commitment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you explain what is
a spiritual warrior.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That who can see and
do, but he cannot and do on a physical level. Perceive what would be
considered, imagine and perceive, and then do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The tribe of Ephraim which
was blessed before Manasseh when it should have been the other way around why
was that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This represents the
physical force manifesting in the earth, the spiritual force coming first, but
in reality the physical force appears to be first. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was Ephraim the spiritual
force?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You would consider it
a spiritual nature.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Why then in The Revelation
Ephraim is not mentioned in the seal?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is transported or
transformed into the other force. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Manasseh and Ephraim are
one in Revelation?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This would be
adequate. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell us about
the law of movement in the fourth dimension?</span></p>

the law of movement in the fourth dimension?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Sounds like You're
saying&#8209;love&#8209;movement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Law. The law of movement in
the fourth dimension dictates­ everything moves backwards and then forwards.
Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Backwards and then
forward?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: In an anti&#8209;matter
projectile..</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you explain that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It would take time,
but entering into the fourth dimension moves every cell within Your body to the
opposite side. </span><span lang=FR style='font-size:12.0pt'>Males, females.
Females, neuter. </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Black, white. White,
black. Green, red. Yellows purple. High, low. Once changed over, then entered
into a forward movement of the strongest reflection. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Does that mean that when
your ships cross from the fourth dimension to the third dimension, you too
change?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yeah, that too. </span><span
lang=ES-TRAD style='font-size:12.0pt'>Mmm-Yah-Yah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Yes?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is that why the appearance
is...all the appearances that I've seen seem shorter and shorter?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, they are. Yes,
it is. Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Does it also happen in a
Session?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, so sometimes.</span></p>

entities born into a flesh body?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could that be one of the
reasons for the switForces: over, the sex switForces: over?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Sometimes yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Those are entities that
specifically came from a fourth dimension existence into this earth as
children?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct. Yes.
Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And in that case, is it
right for these entities to make a sex change?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Incorrect. Tampering
around with the centers always cause more damage on the other side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Does it mean that those
entities that came in got switched over and then have to go back out? When they
go back out, the switch is corrected, and something else takes over?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: On the planet which is
opposite earth, does that mean everyone that is on the earth exists there?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is a counterpart
that exists there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Does everything exist
there that's on this earth oppositely?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So that means there's a
group there like us, and they're doing exactly opposite?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: In an indirect,
opposite manner, not for the black forces, as you might think, but as far as on
a physical level of building into the earth. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So that would mean that
other group over there is us, too?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: In an indirect
manner. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: It doesn't necessarily
mean bad. It could also mean just as the laws there are different, too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You are building on
top of the earth. They are building inside theirs. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are you responsible for
them, too?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We are responsible
for as much as we can be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Color, is that also
reversed?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Reverse color, there
is no color. Color is only imagination. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: There is no color? Where
is there no color?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Shocking. Color?
Where is there color? Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you. Is this true
also of sound?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Sound is the reverse
of not having any noise. The more sound, the closer you are to no noise. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Thank you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Ninom: Does that mean that
sounds that aren't in harmony aren't really a sound?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Sounds that are in
harmony are closer to no sounds. Question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In an earlier session you
talked about sounds that are in harmony are like no sounds. Could you explain
what that means?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Silence itself
creates the harmony.  The peace of that Silence creates the harmony. But in the
Silence is the shape of all existence. Actually if you would say(see) into the
existence of that, you would find out that Silence, Perfect Silence can melt
and go through lead. Amazing isn’t it? If you have a clear force-field of
Silence, focus it in direct wavelength of Silence, you could melt lead. Never
knew that before did you?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How would you collect that
kind of a Silence into anything focused?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well that kind of
would be very like, it would be kind of difficult to collect Silence without a
lot of people. If one truly has Silence, then maybe to focus that Silence in a
cone shape and then the (greater) (focus) of the cone. And the greater
proportions of the cone, the greater energy is at the center of the cone,
(where) the cone at the center.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So only a human being can
do this?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Can you tell me what the
planet Vulcan is?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let us say it is the
planet of quick intellect and reasoning and logical thought and less emotional
flare&#8209;ups.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is it like an anti&#8209;matter
planet?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Let us say it
reflects the opposite thoughts of those in the matter of degree, or those in
the third dimension.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is it like the planet
across from the other side of the sun from the earth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Why do the alchemists call
it their planet?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Because it is from
this planet the elemental of fire comes through creation. For remember, in the
earth you have the element of fire that is constantly moving. It is in your
body, the heat of life, the breath of life. When the body is vacant of this, it
is termed to be of dead matter. This is the spirit that gives it heat and light;
the living spirit is the flame of God. The flame of God is the name of God. The
name of God is the of this burning light, the all&#8209;creating power that
heals or destroys the body. It can either create harmony or disease. It can
also generate tremendous amount of heat to destroy or create a planet. It is
from such that all prophecies endeavor to store and walk upon. The elemental
creatures of the salamander walks through all the elements of the earth,
visiting and knowing mans mind. It is termed to be, but yet he understands what
is to happen. Such is the fire element of creation. Such is the fire element
within man. He must know, create and construct his future.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So this is the sun behind
the sun that you talked about?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is the sun behind
all suns.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The fire, the planet
itself, is it talked about in the Kabalah?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What is it called in the
Bible?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is called
&quot;The secret place&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What is the Magnesia of
the alchemists?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is an item that is
of a diamond or more like a silver mixture that is highly liquid, soluble and
movable in shape, form, and density. It is also an item of congeniance of
bringing elements of liquid and solid together, forming a third state.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Do I understand the First
Matter as being Atlantis in Alchemy?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: I, that would be yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The seven metals, do they
go along in the Book of Judges with the chapters, the seven metals do they go
along, like a metal to each 3 chapters?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: (?) You would be able
to place them in this particular Book.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Each metal represents a
certain thought?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: A thought process of
deduction and evaluation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: In the Book of Judges you
said that’s Alchemy. Does that mean each 3 chapters would be one element, one
metal, going on through the 7?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Each particular metal
has storehouses in which they jurisdiction over other elements around. Let not
just one metal that one can say is all there is. But generally speaking there
is just one family of metals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What would they be?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: This not only
applying to the instrument level, but you have the moral and spiritual levels
that would be applying those tools of working with the metals. Along with the
faith aspect as the universal scepter or divide or ruler is faith and then the
hope and the love aspect. Each one represents the family and sphere of the
expression developments. Then with each their expression goes into wisdom and
the wisdom from the knowledge aspect.</span></p>

each particular house that he was working with.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you tell me what's
the nature of true astrology and how we should go about studying it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: True astrology is
when we look outward from our eyes and see that everything around us is made
from God. To go about it with love in our hearts to meet those that we have in
contact with. More and so with those that we can touch, to have patience and
love with them. Rather than to look up above the stars where we cannot reach,
we should look upon the stars that we can reach. That is true astrology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>There have been sunspots
around the sun and they do affect. Sunspots are strange phenomena, (anything
else of interest today) we fully understand its connection. Just as the earth
revolves around the sun, just as the sun moves through space, so does it take
12 months for a year to evolve around each galaxy, that is each constellation
galaxy. And each constellation has the 3 trines or quarters, minor, minor major
and minor majors, you know. Now as we move through these cycles the sun in
order for it to complete its revolution, takes a period to go through the
constellations 11 years. In those 11 years the 11 th year the sun goes through
the sunspots of the 12 th. So sunspots happen every 11 years. Just as the heart
has a diatide or a what would be considered inside count and then the dial
count. Now the counts of the sun is equally the same, you have a outward thrust
that goes throughout the galaxy and an inward thrust. Now the inward thrust is
experienced and then the outward thrust is experienced, each giving a certain
amount of spiritual fibre, for the sun represents only the shadow of the
spiritual sun in the galaxy and Universe. This outward thrust is mechanism that
allows a lot  of static and a lot of emotional happens to accomplish and bring
forth a schedule of learning process. It also brings into the earth’s
atmosphere different particles beyond the known. Now we also have going through
the sun strong comets that can travel as Haley’s comet does to the speed in
which it can go through the sun without being destroyed and picking up the
atoms in its tail in which it passes through the earth depositing in the earth
the fiber’s necessary for the emotional, moral and social happenings,
eruptions, change. Comets are usually said that they bring forth an age and
great men in the earth, great souls of course in the earth are always brought
across by the comets in style. Of course souls that are not so great usually
don’t come in with comets. You have these comets that come and touch the earth
depositing the changing and affects of the society and forcing mankind another
step closer in there spiritual evolution and development. In the year 68 ad you
had a comet that stayed for almost a year hovering over Jerusalem. About 69 AD
the conquest of Jerusalem and the breaking up and sending them throughout the
whole parts of the world by 70 AD. This was foretold by the comet that hovered
over the city of Jerusalem. At that time people would take the comets as signs
of great upheavals and learning the lessons of that time it was passed on. You
have comments that when Nero played there was also a comet, that hovered over
Rome, which also described the falling and total anarchy and breaking up of
Rome. We have also another example of Napoleon who was marching on to the
Russian border in (…) in astrology it was foretold of the comet coming his way,
over across Russia’s plain. See its very interesting how you interpret this
comet, he interpreted it  as positive for him and negative for Russia, but of
course as history played out its sequel it was altogether negative for Napoleon
and of course very beneficial for Russia. So you never know what side the comet
is going to fall on, if its for you or against you its more of an internal
process that happens to let you know. You have the comet Koheutek that came by
the earth but it was too far away from the earth and its effects were not that
crucial, more or less there was a subtle change in society of America and 
other countries that had been affected by its presence, the subtle change that
cannot be seen readily on the outward surface. Comets pick up the atoms and
electrons and protons and neutrons and netrons and all sorts of trons and
trains and absorbs them in the tail and deposits it into the earth. This also
allows children and souls to be born, also allows certain elements of plant
life or seeds to be brought up from the earth. Unknown things that have to take
a long time before the earth is ready to manifest that. And that is another
interesting topic the patience on the manifestation of the ideal or truth that
when the seeds are ready to be grown, but its like an acorn, oak tree, it’s a
small, small seed, but it waits many years before it takes root and finally
when it does it blossoms up to a very huge tree. Now this is something we have
to understand that the time-space that there are many seeds in the soul of man
and he has to go through the dark periods and the seeds must cultivate and
culminate and finally bursts forth and becomes developed and starts growing the
true qualities and refinement and it creates the society. So comets are not to
be taken lightly, along with the planting of your soul within side and making
sure that it does manifest some day.</span></p>

the next big Time Travel project?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It was a complicated
concept, but hanging in there with the thoughts and we mean this in the most
compassionate way, the atomic bomb was also an element of time presence time
factors, an element of the ratio of energy of the co-ordinates focusing of the
co-ordinates of the earth. From there came what you will know as the
Philadelphia Experiment. We will call it the Epoch of the approach. It is like
a Black Hole of a smaller version and what happens is from the detonation point
literally turns time inside out and then outside in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: About the question before,
do I understand it aright that the atom bomb can’t be set off unless your at a
certain co-ordinate latitude and longitude, is that correct or can they be
exploded anywhere?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Your not supposed to
know this, so therefore maybe we shouldn’t say it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I’ve heard it before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Then if you’ve heard
it before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So all these things they
say their going to launch an atomic attack is all a bunch of malarkey?</span></p>

to stand on the street corner doubting their word either. But it is true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: They can only go off at a
certain latitude and longitude?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: But everything, yes
its true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So who figured out the
Time Machine it seems it was a lot of big to do about nothing and they got
nowhere, who actually got it right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well, can we go back
a little bit, the Time Machine was given to the Egyptians in the Pyramid form
and was used specially specifically for Time Travel. You’ve come upon the
pyramids, it is a weight to balance the earth, but it is also a counter lock to
that energy field that allows time travel to happen. Now we don’t mean to be
absurd or challenge civilization, but every 10,000 increment years this time
travel lock is open and it puts us at the time of Moses when it was open again
and now it relatively can put us close to that time happening again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Now when we talk about Time
Travel are we talking about just the future or is it possible to go back into
the past?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Both ways can be
accomplished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: If we go back into the
past can anything be touched or changed?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Going in the past
creates you to the etheric, where you cannot alter and in fact going in the
future creates an etheric where you cannot alter</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: You said the Time Lock at
the time of Moses to now, would that be 10,000 years?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There is a Time Lock
variance, it begins to happen in this era. The variance takes part of the
opening. There is an opening of a etheric level, spirit level, and a physical
level. Each level is part of the opening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: (excerpt)But what we
are also speaking about etheric, spiritual, spirit, and physical. For it to
finally manifest takes a completion of many thousands of years again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: When you time travel
though if you go in the past like Jesus I understood went to the past, was
Melchizedek, so he did change something, but when you change something in the
past, its  already done everything?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Already done before
you change it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: It already moves at once.
All three past, present, and future move at the same time and nobody ever
notices any change.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Each time we try to
understand how many years ago everything from Moses to Adam and Eve to whatever
else, Noah’s Flood took place. It seems we come up with different sets of
years, is that because we need a different concept for looking at it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: For example.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How many years ago in
years as we understand them physically was Moses?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well it was not
10,000 for sure. But what we were saying or implying the beginning of the Door
(Dog) to the time travel field in Egypt is now beginning to happen. It might
take another down the road to meet up with 10,000.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Was that when the Entity,
when we were in Egypt that the door opened up?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: There was such a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I was wondering if maybe
you could describe maybe a little bit like what your life is like?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is boring you
wouldn’t like it. We find ourselves to be in a space, sometimes without form or
movement, but a space that is encompassing at all in all. We find it to be a
(light path ?) and strong in its own force. But we also have to be the
Watchers, which is a job of continuous activity. Its not an easy job to one day
wake up and say we will not have the leaves be green, we will turn them to be
pink or blue. Or the sunset to be or the sky to be blue, rather than to be red,
yellow. So all in all we are the Keepers and the Watchers. Making sure the
(Panel ?) doesn’t digress too much.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Could you help me
understand the Language of the Birds. Phonetics?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is also a Language
from the tribes of South America and it is what was called their language.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: How does it work?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It works by the very
feel and sense of the environment and the area. One doesn’t have to say words
to be able to see them. And one does not have to hear sounds in able to
understand them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Also the time travel from
last session. I understand you can travel back physically and yet you said you
couldn’t, you could only do it ethericly. You cannot travel back at all
physically?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You can travel back
physically too, but it is etheric first then physically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So your etheric body
travels and then you bring the physical with you?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, but the etheric level
first, all the time. If that does not materialize then the physical can never
come.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And the Smith guy in
Boston, was he making use, you said he did the same thing I was doing and I’m
working on the Tarot. I call it Tarot. Is Tarot the time travel?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: It is called the
Travel of Lights, yes. To travel the Road. That’s where the Tarot comes from,
to travel the road.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Are Leprechauns and Elves
and Fairies, are they elementals or their in a world to themselves or can you
explain how it all ties together?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Leprechauns,
elementals and fairies. Well there are tremendous categories. Leprechauns are
of a chief category found in Ireland, only in Ireland. Elementals are found
everywhere and are the little people everywhere, from all different walks there
are elementals for the homage of those spirits. And of course in order to
achieve anything that we want to accomplish one must communicate with these
spirits or elements. You cannot achieve anything unless you perceive the spirit
and give homage to that spirit. As difficult as it is or as easy as it is. And
believe Us it is easy if you want to achieve anything offer up to the gods
first or the elements so that they will succeed in supporting your cause. But
no one can succeed without that of asking the elements to hand down what is
necessary and needed. Of course the fairies are the winged people and these are
the etheric wings which hover upon flower and plants and leaves and tree, and
all that which gives fruit. And that is only where you will find those and at
the base of trees and flowing rivers and fall and ice and snow and rock and
glacier and sunsets and sunrises and moonbeams and other galaxies beyond.
Remember they come from other galaxies. They do not and cannot belong totally
to the earth.        </span></p>

plane, Sephra would be the line, Sapher would be the point.  Is that the
correct way ---- ?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: In discussing what? 
In talking about that in a 3rd dimension or fourth dimension?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: More going from the 3rd
dimension to the 4th dimension, like in projective math.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Then that would be
correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The whole book of Yetzirah
is a mathematical book?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That’s right, that's
exactly what we are saying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Projective geometry?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And that's how they built
the diagram of the Tree of Life?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forced.  We would correctly
say that to be true, yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: If I study that I'll
understand more?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well hopefully, yeah
of course you will.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And what?  That (?) you
said in the last session, the Crystal Structure of Time.  Could you explain
more about that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: That's the doorway
that holds all things together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What does that mean?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Crystal Structure
of Time is the process, that is the solidification and the glue and the
ointment that merges this galaxy with that of the Transpot galaxy, and of other
galaxies.  It is the concrete form that creates the solidification of your mass
and gives its form by its very presence to time.  For without time and if time
did not exist, then your world as you know it would not be in existence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So its sort of like the
movie the Matrix?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We would say so yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: That was a program, then
who's holding this program.  Sort of like programmed reality, who&quot;s
holding--?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: We would say every
one of you are.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the joint mind of all
mankind on earth are what hold this, sort of like projective reality?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, exactly right. 
That's why murder kind-a goes against that.  Because  murder of anything of
this vibration goes against it.  Because it breaks the Crystal Structure of
Time and every murder that happens assaults the Crystal of Time.  And that
would mean your reality, as you know it would be totally broken down.  That is
why if someone is in that state of murdering another person, then the crime
should not be murder to the person who created murder.  The crime of course
should be life imprisonment or banished to another galaxy or planet, but murder
should not be murder to that of murder.  Does that follow.  It's not a question
of morality or conscience anymore, but it’s a question of the Law of the
Galaxies.  If someone breaks the Crystal of Time, then it breaks the
consciousness of your existence.  Therefore your existence no longer exists
once murder happens. Therefore when one creates a murder it assaults the
Crystal of time.  But then when your powers of authority in retribution to that
murder, creates murder, it is assaulting the same Crystal of Time.  So this
will be the platform to help those who are fighting against conscientiousness, 
that is against that of murdering those who murder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is the Crystal of Time
just for this planet?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Crystal of Time
is that solidification of the Beacon of Light that goes through all galaxies. 
But the Crystal of Time is the essence that creates the, the Solar System. 
When the Crystal of Time is fractured to a point, the,   it comes on itself and
no longer exists.  What you then experience as the Black Hole, no form.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Is that the Crystal that
was in a lower, more, position in the earth at the time of Atlantis.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And that is they did have
Time travel and that is how they had Time travel?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Exactly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So you could take lets say
someone from one Time to another?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: With  no problem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: As a punishment lets say
and put them in another place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: With  no problem,
yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Did they have also
inter-dimensional things or other dimensions meaning other Time warps, other
no, other realities?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes exactly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So they could take people
and banish them just into another reality?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Even at the same Time?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And then they could create
different colonies or that kind of situation?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Exactly that's where
the colonies can come from.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What was the experiment,
the Time experiments, in that it seemed like they were pretty advanced on the
Titanic.  So what were the experiments before that?  In that century, when did
they start?  And the one before that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: When did what start?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: The Titanic seemed like a
pretty well organized experiment so they must have tried it before.  What was
the one before the Titanic?  Or was there one?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well yes there were
many.  The burning of the great library of,  of, of Athens, of Egypt was one,
the Great what would be considered plague, the Black Plague of Europe was one. 
That was what would be considered a Time crescent warp  (War) that hit, and it
hit in such a, a, a division that the cells of the body were falling apart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Did someone create that
from that time?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well of course it was
created just like, yes, yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Who were the ones who were
creating it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The ones that were
trying to do it, experimented.  We, ah the Medical profession lets say at that
moment who were trying to make breakthroughs of what’s inside the body, but at
that same time trying to make the breakthrough of the Spirit body with the
physical body, which created the Black Plague there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So even if people want to
look at this point in regard to find a way to Time travel and stuff like that,
I mean this is really very dangerous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: What?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: To even  try  to find the
Time travel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well it can cause a
great deal of havoc if entered into it in the wrong way, yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the Atlanteans were
able to achieve it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: And do it, yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: But that’s because they
were centered on the Crystal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, or into their
centering of that Spirit yes definitely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And who was the controller
of that Crystal?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Controller of a
Crystal were the five Kings of Atlantis, they came together to Judge the
governments with Wisdom and Love and Kindness, until they got corrupt</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: And who created the
Crystal?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: The Crystal is the
Form of the Formlessness that is there and only comes into form from the
Formlessness and those who call it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So the Crystal is always
there?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: It can always be called
upon, but if a corrupt thing calls it, it comes in corrupt?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Yes, exactly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: I have one more question,
about the Bible code I was thinking instead of putting in the way we do now
Names  and trying to find them.  Can't you put in like a date, numbers, like
1999 as the skip distance?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You can but you have
to separate that distance from that place in which you are doing it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: What does that mean?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Well what we are
trying to say is that you have to slow time down, so time doesn’t catch up to
you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: So I could put it at the
bottom of the program, that date, would you find any thing out about that time?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: You could we would
see that possible, yes.  It’s quite feasible yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Q: Would that be the more
accurate way to do it?</span></p>

on that, like you started giving some formulas..? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Forces: Polaric energy is
also like the Aurora Borealis that you see, that is the electrical field that
is around all things and the energy is very increased during the day just
before the Sun rises and just before the Sun sets, that's why temperatures go
up and down during the setting of the Sun. </span></p>
